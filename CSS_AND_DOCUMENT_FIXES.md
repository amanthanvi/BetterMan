# CSS and Document Viewer Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Broken CSS (Tailwind not loading)
**Issue**: The page had no styling - Tailwind CSS wasn't being processed
**Root Cause**: Missing PostCSS configuration file
**Fix**: Created `postcss.config.js` with Tailwind and Autoprefixer plugins
```javascript
export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

### 2. Document Viewer 404 Errors
**Issue**: Document viewer was trying to fetch `/api/docs/ls.1/content` which doesn't exist
**Root Cause**: 
- Frontend was expecting a separate content endpoint
- Backend doesn't have a `/content` endpoint - it returns everything in the main document response
- The `raw_content` field wasn't included in the DocumentResponse model

**Fixes Applied**:
1. Modified DocumentViewer component to use document data directly instead of fetching content separately
2. Added `raw_content` to the backend DocumentResponse model
3. Updated the frontend Document type to include `raw_content` and `sections`
4. Populated test documents with actual man page content

## Test Data Added

Added real man page content for three commands:
- `ls` - list directory contents
- `cd` - change directory  
- `grep` - pattern matching

## Result

- CSS is now working properly with Tailwind styles applied
- Document pages load correctly without 404 errors
- Search results link to documents that display actual content
- The application is now fully functional for basic usage

## Next Steps

To make the application production-ready:
1. Install full man page packages in Docker container
2. Create a proper man page loader to import all system commands
3. Parse man pages into structured sections instead of just raw content
4. Add syntax highlighting for command examples
5. Implement the table of contents feature in DocumentViewer
