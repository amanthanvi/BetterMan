# Frontend Syntax Error Fix

## Issue
The frontend was failing to compile with a syntax error in HomePage.tsx:
```
Unexpected token, expected "," (336:11)
```

## Root Cause
The ternary operator in the Popular Commands section was missing:
1. A closing parenthesis after the map function
2. The else clause for when there are no popular commands

## Fix Applied
Changed line 336 from:
```jsx
))}
```

To:
```jsx
))
) : (
    <p className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 text-center py-8">
        No analytics data available yet. Start searching!
    </p>
)}
```

This properly closes the ternary operator that handles:
- Loading state (skeleton)
- Data state (popular commands list)
- Empty state (no analytics message)

## Result
The frontend now compiles successfully and loads at http://localhost:5173
