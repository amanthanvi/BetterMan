## Known Limitations

1. **Limited Content**: Only 3 test commands are loaded
2. **No Authentication**: User system exists but not implemented
3. **Basic Search**: Using LIKE queries instead of full-text search
4. **No Redis Integration**: Redis is running but not connected

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Content Loading**:
   - Install full man page packages in Docker
   - Create proper man page loader
   - Parse man pages into structured sections

2. **Search Enhancement**:
   - Enable SQLite FTS5 for better search
   - Add search filters and advanced options
   - Implement search result ranking

3. **Performance**:
   - Connect Redis for caching
   - Implement proper cache eviction
   - Add CDN for static assets

4. **Features**:
   - User authentication
   - Bookmarks and favorites
   - Export functionality
   - Command history

The application is now in a working state with all core features functional!
