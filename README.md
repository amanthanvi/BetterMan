# BetterMan

BetterMan is an innovative, modern reinterpretation of Linux man pages. This project transforms traditional Unix documentation into a more readable, navigable, and accessible formatâ€”with an architectural foundation designed for future expansion into additional languages and libraries such as Python, Go, Pwntools, and more.

## Overview

- **Modern Presentation:** Clean, approachable UI with improved typography and navigation.
- **MVP Focus:** Starting with Linux man pages.
- **Expandable Framework:** A modular design allowing new documentation sets to be added easily.

## Key Features

- **Readable Formatting:** Converts legacy man pages into Markdown/HTML with enhanced readability.
- **Search & Navigation:** Intuitive, full-text search, dynamic table of contents, and interconnected hyperlinks.
- **Extensibility:** A modular structure to incorporate additional documentation sources seamlessly.
- **Developer-Friendly:** Clear code organization, consistent style guidelines, and comprehensive project documentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/) (or your chosen runtime environment)
