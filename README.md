# BetterMan
BetterMan is an innovative, modern reinterpretation of Linux man pages. The project aims to transform traditional documentation into a more readable, navigable, and accessible format while laying the groundwork to later incorporate documentation from other languages and libraries (e.g., Python, Go, Pwntools).

## Overview

- **Modern Presentation:** Clean, approachable UI with improved typography and navigation.
- **MVP Focus:** Start with Linux man pages and then expand.
- **Expandable Framework:** Modular design so that new docs (languages/libraries) can be added easily.

## Key Features

- **Readable Formatting:** Convert traditional man pages into Markdown/HTML with enhanced readability.
- **Search & Navigation:** Intuitive search, hyperlinks, and a dynamic table of contents.
- **Extensibility:** A modular architecture that allows additional documentation sets to be integrated seamlessly.
- **Developer-Friendly:** Clear code organization, consistent style guidelines, and comprehensive project documentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
