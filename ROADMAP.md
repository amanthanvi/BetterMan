# Roadmap

This project is actively evolving.

- **Product + architecture:** `SPEC.md`
- **What we’re shipping next (living checklist):** `PLAN.md`

## Current focus

- Finish `v0.6.0` verification (a11y/perf/visual/mobile), then tag the release.

## How to help

- Fix papercuts (copy, layout edge-cases, keyboard flow)
- Add regression tests around reported bugs
- Improve docs (especially “getting started” and troubleshooting)
- Triage issues and propose small, scoped PRs
