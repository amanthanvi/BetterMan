## What to include (so we can help fast)

- The URL you were on (or the exact route)
- Distro + version info (if relevant)
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Steps to reproduce
- Screenshots / console logs / network errors (if you have them)

If you’re reporting a production issue and can include a commit SHA or tag, that’s even better.
