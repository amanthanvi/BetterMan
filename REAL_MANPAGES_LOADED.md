# Real Man Pages Successfully Loaded!

## What We Did

1. **Fixed UI Issues**:
   - ✅ TOC sidebar now spans full height
   - ✅ Progress bar moved to header bottom (no longer overlapping)
   - ✅ Command Palette (Ctrl+K) functionality restored
   - ✅ Reduced TOC flickering with CSS-only transitions

2. **Cleaned Database**:
   - ✅ Removed 89 duplicate documents with section='json'
   - ✅ These were metadata files accidentally loaded as documents

3. **Loaded REAL Man Pages**:
   - ✅ Extracted 20 real man pages from your system
   - ✅ Parsed them with proper section headers
   - ✅ Stored full content in the database

## Available Commands

The following REAL man pages are now loaded:
- **Core utilities**: ls, cp, mv, rm, mkdir, cat, echo, pwd, chmod
- **Text processing**: grep, sed, awk, cut, sort
- **Development**: git, make, python3
- **Network**: curl, wget, ssh

## How to Add More Man Pages

1. Edit `extract_host_manpages.sh` to add more commands
2. Run: `./extract_host_manpages.sh`
3. Copy to Docker: `docker cp extracted_manpages betterman-backend-1:/app/`
4. Load them: `docker exec betterman-backend-1 python3 load_extracted_manpages.py`

## Testing

1. Go to http://localhost:5173
2. Search for any loaded command (e.g., "ls", "grep", "git")
3. You should see:
   - Full man page content
   - Proper sections (NAME, SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, etc.)
   - All flags and options with descriptions
   - Examples and references

## Notes

- The man pages are the actual content from your Ubuntu system
- They include all sections, not simplified versions
- The parser handles groff/troff formatting
- Content is stored as structured JSON for easy rendering
