feat: add missing pages, icons, and expand command database

- Add app/docs/[slug]/page.tsx for dynamic documentation pages
- Add app/search/page.tsx for dedicated search page
- Add missing PWA icons (icon-192x192.png, icon-512x512.png)
- Expand command database from 1 to 8 popular commands
- Update search indices with more commands (ls, cd, grep, find, cat, echo, mkdir, rm)
- Fix routing and navigation throughout the app

This completes the basic functionality of the BetterMan app with:
- Working home page with 8 popular commands
- Dynamic documentation pages for each command
- Search functionality
- PWA support with proper icons
