If the standard output is a\n     terminal, the standard output is appended to the file nohup.out in the\n     current directory.  If standard error is a terminal, it is directed to\n     the same place as the standard output.\n\n     Some shells may provide a builtin nohup command which is similar or\n     identical to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.\n",

        "     The nohup utility exits with one of the following values:\n\n     126     The utility was found, but could not be invoked.\n\n     127     The utility could not be found or an error occurred in nohup.\n\n     Otherwise, the exit status of nohup will be that of utility.\n",
