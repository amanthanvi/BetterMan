        "     For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, ls\n     displays its name as well as any requested, associated information.  For\n     each operand that names a file of type directory, ls displays the names\n     of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested,\n     associated information.\n\n     If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are\n     displayed.  If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are\n     displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted\n     separately and in lexicographical order.\n\n     The following options are available:\n\n     -@      Display extended attribute keys and sizes in long (-l) output.\n\n     -A      Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (‘.’)\n\t     except for . and ...  Automatically set for the super-user unless\n\t     -I is specified.\n\n     -B      Force printing of non-printable characters (as defined by\n\t     ctype(3) and current locale settings) in file names as \\xxx,\n\t     where xxx is the numeric value of the character in octal.\tThis\n\t     option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -C      Force multi-column output; this is the default when output is to\n\t     a terminal.\n\n     -D format\n\t     When printing in the long (-l) format, use format to format the\n\t     date and time output.  The argument format is a string used by\n\t     strftime(3).  Depending on the choice of format string, this may\n\t     result in a different number of columns in the output.  This\n\t     option overrides the -T option.  This option is not defined in\n\t     IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -F      Display a slash (‘/’) immediately after each pathname that is a\n\t     directory, an asterisk (‘*’) after each that is executable, an at\n\t     sign (‘@’) after each symbolic link, an equals sign (‘=’) after\n\t     each socket, a percent sign (‘%’) after each whiteout, and a\n\t     vertical bar (‘|’) after each that is a FIFO.\n\n     -G      Enable colorized output.  This option is equivalent to defining\n\t     CLICOLOR or COLORTERM in the environment and setting\n\t     --color=auto.  (See below.)  This functionality can be compiled\n\t     out by removing the definition of COLORLS.  This option is not\n\t     defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -H      Symbolic links on the command line are followed.  This option is\n\t     assumed if none of the -F, -d, or -l options are specified.\n\n     -I      Prevent -A from being automatically set for the super-user.  This\n\t     option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -L      Follow all symbolic links to final target and list the file or\n\t     directory the link references rather than the link itself.  This\n\t     option cancels the -P option.\n\n     -O      Include the file flags in a long (-l) output.  This option is\n\t     incompatible with IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).  See\n\t     chflags(1) for a list of file flags and their meanings.\n\n     -P      If argument is a symbolic link, list the link itself rather than\n\t     the object the link references.  This option cancels the -H and\n\t     -L options.\n\n     -R      Recursively list subdirectories encountered.\n\n     -S      Sort by size (largest file first) before sorting the operands in\n\t     lexicographical order.\n\n     -T      When printing in the long (-l) format, display complete time\n\t     information for the file, including month, day, hour, minute,\n\t     second, and year.\tThe -D option gives even more control over the\n\t     output format.  This option is not defined in IEEE Std\n\t     1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -U      Use time when file was created for sorting or printing.  This\n\t     option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -W      Display whiteouts when scanning directories.  This option is not\n\t     defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -X      When listing recursively, do not descend into directories that\n\t     would cross file system boundaries.  More specifically, this\n\t     option will prevent descending into directories that have a\n\t     different device number.\n\n     -a      Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (‘.’).\n\n     -b      As -B, but use C escape codes whenever possible.  This option is\n\t     not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -c      Use time when file status was last changed for sorting or\n\t     printing.\n\n     --color=when\n\t     Output colored escape sequences based on when, which may be set\n\t     to either always, auto, or never.\n\n\t     always will make ls always output color.  If TERM is unset or set\n\t     to an invalid terminal, then ls will fall back to explicit ANSI\n\t     escape sequences without the help of termcap(5).  always is the\n\t     default if --color is specified without an argument.\n\n\t     auto will make ls output escape sequences based on termcap(5),\n\t     but only if stdout is a tty and either the -G flag is specified\n\t     or the COLORTERM environment variable is set and not empty.\n\n\t     never will disable color regardless of environment variables.\n\t     never is the default when neither --color nor -G is specified.\n\n\t     For compatibility with GNU coreutils, ls supports yes or force as\n\t     equivalent to always, no or none as equivalent to never, and tty\n\t     or if-tty as equivalent to auto.\n\n     -d      Directories are listed as plain files (not searched recursively).\n\n     -e      Print the Access Control List (ACL) associated with the file, if\n\t     present, in long (-l) output.\n\n     -f      Output is not sorted.  This option turns on -a.  It also negates\n\t     the effect of the -r, -S and -t options.  As allowed by IEEE Std\n\t     1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”), this option has no effect on the -d, -l,\n\t     -R and -s options.\n\n     -g      This option has no effect.  It is only available for\n\t     compatibility with 4.3BSD, where it was used to display the group\n\t     name in the long (-l) format output.  This option is incompatible\n\t     with IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -h      When used with the -l option, use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte,\n\t     Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte in order to reduce the\n\t     number of digits to four or fewer using base 2 for sizes.\tThis\n\t     option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -i      For each file, print the file's file serial number (inode\n\t     number).\n\n     -k      This has the same effect as setting environment variable\n\t     BLOCKSIZE to 1024, except that it also nullifies any -h options\n\t     to its left.\n\n     -l      (The lowercase letter “ell”.) List files in the long format, as\n\t     described in the The Long Format subsection below.\n\n     -m      Stream output format; list files across the page, separated by\n\t     commas.\n\n     -n      Display user and group IDs numerically rather than converting to\n\t     a user or group name in a long (-l) output.  This option turns on\n\t     the -l option.\n\n     -o      List in long format, but omit the group id.\n\n     -p      Write a slash (‘/’) after each filename if that file is a\n\t     directory.\n\n     -q      Force printing of non-graphic characters in file names as the\n\t     character ‘?’; this is the default when output is to a terminal.\n\n     -r      Reverse the order of the sort.\n\n     -s      Display the number of blocks used in the file system by each\n\t     file.  Block sizes and directory totals are handled as described\n\t     in The Long Format subsection below, except (if the long format\n\t     is not also requested) the directory totals are not output when\n\t     the output is in a single column, even if multi-column output is\n\t     requested.  (-l) format, display complete time information for\n\t     the file, including month, day, hour, minute, second, and year.\n\t     The -D option gives even more control over the output format.\n\t     This option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -t      Sort by descending time modified (most recently modified first).\n\t     If two files have the same modification timestamp, sort their\n\t     names in ascending lexicographical order.\tThe -r option reverses\n\t     both of these sort orders.\n\n\t     Note that these sort orders are contradictory: the time sequence\n\t     is in descending order, the lexicographical sort is in ascending\n\t     order.  This behavior is mandated by IEEE Std 1003.2 (“POSIX.2”).\n\t     This feature can cause problems listing files stored with\n\t     sequential names on FAT file systems, such as from digital\n\t     cameras, where it is possible to have more than one image with\n\t     the same timestamp.  In such a case, the photos cannot be listed\n\t     in the sequence in which they were taken.\tTo ensure the same\n\t     sort order for time and for lexicographical sorting, set the\n\t     environment variable LS_SAMESORT or use the -y option.  This\n\t     causes ls to reverse the lexicographical sort order when sorting\n\t     files with the same modification timestamp.\n\n     -u      Use time of last access, instead of time of last modification of\n\t     the file for sorting (-t) or long printing (-l).\n\n     -v      Force unedited printing of non-graphic characters; this is the\n\t     default when output is not to a terminal.\n\n     -w      Force raw printing of non-printable characters.  This is the\n\t     default when output is not to a terminal.\tThis option is not\n\t     defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -x      The same as -C, except that the multi-column output is produced\n\t     with entries sorted across, rather than down, the columns.\n\n     -y      When the -t option is set, sort the alphabetical output in the\n\t     same order as the time output.  This has the same effect as\n\t     setting LS_SAMESORT.  See the description of the -t option for\n\t     more details.  This option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001\n\t     (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     -%      Distinguish dataless files and directories with a '%' character\n\t     in long (-l) output, and don't materialize dataless directories\n\t     when listing them.\n\n     -1      (The numeric digit “one”.) Force output to be one entry per line.\n\t     This is the default when output is not to a terminal.\n\n     -,      (Comma) When the -l option is set, print file sizes grouped and\n\t     separated by thousands using the non-monetary separator returned\n\t     by localeconv(3), typically a comma or period.  If no locale is\n\t     set, or the locale does not have a non-monetary separator, this\n\t     option has no effect.  This option is not defined in IEEE Std\n\t     1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”).\n\n     The -1, -C, -x, and -l options all override each other; the last one\n     specified determines the format used.\n\n     The -c, -u, and -U options all override each other; the last one\n     specified determines the file time used.\n\n     The -S and -t options override each other; the last one specified\n     determines the sort order used.\n\n     The -B, -b, -w, and -q options all override each other; the last one\n     specified determines the format used for non-printable characters.\n\n     The -H, -L and -P options all override each other (either partially or\n     fully); they are applied in the order specified.\n\n     By default, ls lists one entry per line to standard output; the\n     exceptions are to terminals or when the -C or -x options are specified.\n\n     File information is displayed with one or more ⟨blank⟩s separating the\n     information associated with the -i, -s, and -l options.\n",
        "     If the -l option is given, the following information is displayed for\n     each file: file mode, number of links, owner name, group name, number of\n     bytes in the file, abbreviated month, day-of-month file was last\n     modified, hour file last modified, minute file last modified, and the\n     pathname.\tIf the file or directory has extended attributes, the\n     permissions field printed by the -l option is followed by a '@'\n     character.  Otherwise, if the file or directory has extended security\n     information (such as an access control list), the permissions field\n     printed by the -l option is followed by a '+' character.  If the -%\n     option is given, a '%' character follows the permissions field for\n     dataless files and directories, possibly replacing the '@' or '+'\n     character.\n\n     If the modification time of the file is more than 6 months in the past or\n     future, and the -D or -T are not specified, then the year of the last\n     modification is displayed in place of the hour and minute fields.\n\n     If the owner or group names are not a known user or group name, or the -n\n     option is given, the numeric ID's are displayed.\n\n     If the file is a character special or block special file, the device\n     number for the file is displayed in the size field.  If the file is a\n     symbolic link the pathname of the linked-to file is preceded by “->”.\n\n     The listing of a directory's contents is preceded by a labeled total\n     number of blocks used in the file system by the files which are listed as\n     the directory's contents (which may or may not include . and .. and other\n     files which start with a dot, depending on other options).\n\n     The default block size is 512 bytes.  The block size may be set with\n     option -k or environment variable BLOCKSIZE.  Numbers of blocks in the\n     output will have been rounded up so the numbers of bytes is at least as\n     many as used by the corresponding file system blocks (which might have a\n     different size).\n\n     The file mode printed under the -l option consists of the entry type and\n     the permissions.  The entry type character describes the type of file, as\n     follows:\n\n\t   -\t Regular file.\n\t   b\t Block special file.\n\t   c\t Character special file.\n\t   d\t Directory.\n\t   l\t Symbolic link.\n\t   p\t FIFO.\n\t   s\t Socket.\n\t   w\t Whiteout.\n\n     The next three fields are three characters each: owner permissions, group\n     permissions, and other permissions.

The -H, -L and -P options all override each other (either partially or fully); they are applied in the order specified. By default, ls lists one entry per line to standard output; the exceptions are to terminals or when the -C or -x options are specified. File information is displayed with one or more ⟨blank⟩s separating the information associated with the -i, -s, and -l options. The Long Format If the -l option is given, the following information is displayed for each file: file mode, number of links, owner name, group name, number of bytes in the file, abbreviated month, day-of-month file was last modified, hour file last modified, minute file last modified, and the pathname.\tIf the file or directory has extended attributes, the permissions field printed by the -l option is followed by a '@' character.  Otherwise, if the file or directory has extended security information (such as an access control list), the permissions field printed by the -l option is followed by a '+' character.  If the -% option is given, a '%' character follows the permissions field for dataless files and directories, possibly replacing the '@' or '+' character. If the modification time of the file is more than 6 months in the past or future, and the -D or -T are not specified, then the year of the last modification is displayed in place of the hour and minute fields. If the owner or group names are not a known user or group name, or the -n option is given, the numeric ID's are displayed. If the file is a character special or block special file, the device number for the file is displayed in the size field.  If the file is a symbolic link the pathname of the linked-to file is preceded by “->”. The listing of a directory's contents is preceded by a labeled total number of blocks used in the file system by the files which are listed as the directory's contents (which may or may not include . and .. and other files which start with a dot, depending on other options). The default block size is 512 bytes.  The block size may be set with option -k or environment variable BLOCKSIZE.  Numbers of blocks in the output will have been rounded up so the numbers of bytes is at least as many as used by the corresponding file system blocks (which might have a different size). The file mode printed under the -l option consists of the entry type and the permissions.  The entry type character describes the type of file, as follows: -\t Regular file. b\t Block special file. c\t Character special file. d\t Directory. l\t Symbolic link. p\t FIFO. s\t Socket. w\t Whiteout. The next three fields are three characters each: owner permissions, group permissions, and other permissions.  Each field has three character positions: 1.\tIf r, the file is readable; if -, it is not readable. 2.\tIf w, the file is writable; if -, it is not writable. 3.\tThe first of the following that applies: S     If in the owner permissions, the file is not executable and set-user-ID mode is set.  If in the group permissions, the file is not executable and set-group-ID mode is set. s     If in the owner permissions, the file is executable and set-user-ID mode is set.  If in the group permissions, the file is executable and setgroup-ID mode is set. x     The file is executable or the directory is searchable. -     The file is neither readable, writable, executable, nor set-user-ID nor set-group-ID mode, nor sticky.  (See below.) These next two apply only to the third character in the last group (other permissions). T     The sticky bit is set (mode 1000), but not execute or search permission.  (See chmod(1) or sticky(7).) t     The sticky bit is set (mode 1000), and is searchable or executable.  (See chmod(1) or sticky(7).) The next field contains a plus (‘+’) character if the file has an ACL, or a space (‘ ’) if it does not.  The ls utility does not show the actual ACL unless the -e option is used in conjunction with the -l option."

1003 1-2008 posix 1 -i for each file print the file s file serial number inode number -k this has the same effect as setting environment variable blocksize to 1024 except that it also nullifies any -h options to its left -l the lowercase letter ell list files in the long format as described in the the long format subsection below -m stream output format list files across the page separated by commas -n display user and group ids numerically rather than converting to a user or group name in a long -l output this option turns on the -l option -o list in long format but omit the group id -p write a slash after each filename if that file is a directory -q force printing of non-graphic characters in file names as the character this is the default when output is to a terminal -r reverse the order of the sort -s display the number of blocks used in the file system by each file block sizes and directory totals are handled as described in the long format subsection below except if the long format is not also requested the directory totals are not output when the output is in a single column even if multi-column output is requested -l format display complete time information for the file including month day hour minute second and year the -d option gives even more control over the output format this option is not defined in ieee std 1003 1-2008 posix 1 -t sort by descending time modified most recently modified first if two files have the same modification timestamp sort their names in ascending lexicographical order the -r option reverses both of these sort orders note that these sort orders are contradictory the time sequence is in descending order the lexicographical sort is in ascending order this behavior is mandated by ieee std 1003 2 posix 2 this feature can cause problems listing files stored with sequential names on fat file systems such as from digital cameras where it is possible to have more than one image with the same timestamp in such a case the photos cannot be listed in the sequence in which they were taken to ensure the same sort order for time and for lexicographical sorting set the environment variable ls samesort or use the -y option this causes ls to reverse the lexicographical sort order when sorting files with the same modification timestamp -u use time of last access instead of time of last modification of the file for sorting -t or long printing -l -v force unedited printing of non-graphic characters this is the default when output is not to a terminal -w force raw printing of non-printable characters this is the default when output is not to a terminal this option is not defined in ieee std 1003 1-2001 posix 1 -x the same as -c except that the multi-column output is produced with entries sorted across rather than down the columns -y when the -t option is set sort the alphabetical output in the same order as the time output this has the same effect as setting ls samesort see the description of the -t option for more details this option is not defined in ieee std 1003 1-2001 posix 1 - distinguish dataless files and directories with a character in long -l output and don t materialize dataless directories when listing them -1 the numeric digit one force output to be one entry per line this is the default when output is not to a terminal - comma when the -l option is set print file sizes grouped and separated by thousands using the non-monetary separator returned by localeconv 3 typically a comma or period if no locale is set or the locale does not have a non-monetary separator this option has no effect this option is not defined in ieee std 1003 1-2001 posix 1 the -1 -c -x and -l options all override each other the last one specified determines the format used the -c -u and -u options all override each other the last one specified determines the file time used the -s and -t options override each other the last one specified determines the sort order used the -b -b -w and -q options all override each other the last one specified determines the format used for non-printable characters the -h -l and -p options all override each other either partially or fully they are applied in the order specified by default ls lists one entry per line to standard output the exceptions are to terminals or when the -c or -x options are specified file information is displayed with one or more blank s separating the information associated with the -i -s and -l options the long format if the -l option is given the following information is displayed for each file file mode number of links owner name group name number of bytes in the file abbreviated month day-of-month file was last modified hour file last modified minute file last modified and the pathname if the file or directory has extended attributes the permissions field printed by the -l option is followed by a character otherwise if the file or directory has extended security information such as an access control list the permissions field printed by the -l option is followed by a character if the - option is given a character follows the permissions field for dataless files and directories possibly replacing the or character if the modification time of the file is more than 6 months in the past or future and the -d or -t are not specified then the year of the last modification is displayed in place of the hour and minute fields if the owner or group names are not a known user or group name or the -n option is given the numeric id s are displayed if the file is a character special or block special file the device number for the file is displayed in the size field if the file is a symbolic link the pathname of the linked-to file is preceded by - the listing of a directory s contents is preceded by a labeled total number of blocks used in the file system by the files which are listed as the directory s contents which may or may not include and and other files which start with a dot depending on other options the default block size is 512 bytes the block size may be set with option -k or environment variable blocksize numbers of blocks in the output will have been rounded up so the numbers of bytes is at least as many as used by the corresponding file system blocks which might have a different size the file mode printed under the -l option consists of the entry type and the permissions the entry type character describes the type of file as follows - regular file b block special file c character special file d directory l symbolic link p fifo s socket w whiteout the next three fields are three characters each owner permissions group permissions and other permissions each field has three character positions 1 if r the file is readable if - it is not readable 2 if w the file is writable if - it is not writable 3 the first of the following that applies s if in the owner permissions the file is not executable and set-user-id mode is set if in the group permissions the file is not executable and set-group-id mode is set s if in the owner permissions the file is executable and set-user-id mode is set if in the group permissions the file is executable and setgroup-id mode is set x the file is executable or the directory is searchable - the file is neither readable writable executable nor set-user-id nor set-group-id mode nor sticky see below these next two apply only to the third character in the last group other permissions t the sticky bit is set mode 1000 but not execute or search permission see chmod 1 or sticky 7 t the sticky bit is set mode 1000 and is searchable or executable see chmod 1 or sticky 7 the next field contains a plus character if the file has an acl or a space if it does not the ls utility does not show the actual acl unless the -e option is used
