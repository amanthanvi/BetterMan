        "     The seq utility prints a sequence of numbers, one per line (default),\n     from first (default 1), to near last as possible, in increments of incr\n     (default 1).  When first is larger than last, the default incr is -1.\n\n     All numbers are interpreted as floating point.\n\n     Normally integer values are printed as decimal integers.\n\n     The seq utility accepts the following options:\n\n     -f format, --format format\n\t\t   Use a printf(3) style format to print each number.  Only\n\t\t   the A, a, E, e, F, f, G, g, and % conversion characters are\n\t\t   valid, along with any optional flags and an optional\n\t\t   numeric minimum field width or precision.  The format can\n\t\t   contain character escape sequences in backslash notation as\n\t\t   defined in ANSI X3.159-1989 (“ANSI C89”).  The default is\n\t\t   %g.\n\n     -s string, --separator string\n\t\t   Use string to separate numbers.  The string can contain\n\t\t   character escape sequences in backslash notation as defined\n\t\t   in ANSI X3.159-1989 (“ANSI C89”).  The default is \\n.\n\n     -t string, --terminator string\n\t\t   Use string to terminate sequence of numbers.  The string\n\t\t   can contain character escape sequences in backslash\n\t\t   notation as defined in ANSI X3.159-1989 (“ANSI C89”).  This\n\t\t   option is useful when the default separator does not\n\t\t   contain a \\n.\n\n     -w, --fixed-width\n\t\t   Equalize the widths of all numbers by padding with zeros as\n\t\t   necessary.  This option has no effect with the -f option.\n\t\t   If any sequence numbers will be printed in exponential\n\t\t   notation, the default conversion is changed to %e.\n",
