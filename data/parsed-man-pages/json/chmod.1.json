Beware of unintentionally\n\t     matching the “..” hard link to the parent directory when using\n\t     wildcards like “.*”.\n\n     -v      Cause chmod to be verbose, showing filenames as the mode is\n\t     modified.\tIf the -v flag is specified more than once, the old\n\t     and new modes of the file will also be printed, in both octal and\n\t     symbolic notation.\n\n     The -H, -L and -P options are ignored unless the -R option is specified.\n     In addition, these options override each other and the command's actions\n     are determined by the last one specified.\n\n     If chmod receives a SIGINFO signal (see the status argument for stty(1)),\n     then the current filename as well as the old and new modes are displayed.\n\n     Only the owner of a file or the super-user is permitted to change the\n     mode of a file.\n",
        "     The chmod utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.\n",
        "     Modes may be absolute or symbolic.  An absolute mode is an octal number\n     constructed from the sum of one or more of the following values:\n\n\t   4000    (the setuid bit).  Executable files with this bit set will\n\t\t   run with effective uid set to the uid of the file owner.\n\t\t   Directories with this bit set will force all files and sub-\n\t\t   directories created in them to be owned by the directory\n\t\t   owner and not by the uid of the creating process, if the\n\t\t   underlying file system supports this feature: see chmod(2)\n\t\t   and the suiddir option to mount(8).\n\t   2000    (the setgid bit).  Executable files with this bit set will\n\t\t   run with effective gid set to the gid of the file owner.\n\t   1000    (the sticky bit).  See chmod(2) and sticky(7).\n\t   0400    Allow read by owner.\n\t   0200    Allow write by owner.\n\t   0100    For files, allow execution by owner.  For directories,\n\t\t   allow the owner to search in the directory.\n\t   0040    Allow read by group members.\n\t   0020    Allow write by group members.\n\t   0010    For files, allow execution by group members.

For directories\n\t\t   allow others to search in the directory.\n\n     For example, the absolute mode that permits read, write and execute by\n     the owner, read and execute by group members, read and execute by others,\n     and no set-uid or set-gid behaviour is 755 (400+200+100+040+010+004+001).\n\n     The symbolic mode is described by the following grammar:\n\n\t   mode \t::= clause [, clause ...]\n\t   clause\t::= [who ...] [action ...] action\n\t   action\t::= op [perm ...]\n\t   who\t\t::= a | u | g | o\n\t   op\t\t::= + | - | =\n\t   perm \t::= r | s | t | w | x | X | u | g | o\n\n     The who symbols ``u'', ``g'', and ``o'' specify the user, group, and\n     other parts of the mode bits, respectively.  The who symbol ``a'' is\n     equivalent to ``ugo''.\n\n     The perm symbols represent the portions of the mode bits as follows:\n\n\t   r\t   The read bits.\n\t   s\t   The set-user-ID-on-execution and set-group-ID-on-execution\n\t\t   bits.\n\t   t\t   The sticky bit.\n\t   w\t   The write bits.\n\t   x\t   The execute/search bits.\n\t   X\t   The execute/search bits if the file is a directory or any\n\t\t   of the execute/search bits are set in the original\n\t\t   (unmodified) mode.  Operations with the perm symbol ``X''\n\t\t   are only meaningful in conjunction with the op symbol\n\t\t   ``+'', and are ignored in all other cases.\n\t   u\t   The user permission bits in the original mode of the file.\n\t   g\t   The group permission bits in the original mode of the file.\n\t   o\t   The other permission bits in the original mode of the file.\n\n     The op symbols represent the operation performed, as follows:\n\n     +\t   If no value is supplied for perm, the ``+'' operation has no\n\t   effect.  If no value is supplied for who, each permission bit\n\t   specified in perm, for which the corresponding bit in the file mode\n\t   creation mask (see umask(2)) is clear, is set.  Otherwise, the mode\n\t   bits represented by the specified who and perm values are set.\n\n     -\t   If no value is supplied for perm, the ``-'' operation has no\n\t   effect.  If no value is supplied for who, each permission bit\n\t   specified in perm, for which the corresponding bit in the file mode\n\t   creation mask is set, is cleared.  Otherwise, the mode bits\n\t   represented by the specified who and perm values are cleared.\n\n     =\t   The mode bits specified by the who value are cleared, or, if no who\n\t   value is specified, the owner, group and other mode bits are\n\t   cleared.  Then, if no value is supplied for who, each permission\n\t   bit specified in perm, for which the corresponding bit in the file\n\t   mode creation mask (see umask(2)) is clear, is set.\tOtherwise, the\n\t   mode bits represented by the specified who and perm values are set.\n\n     Each clause specifies one or more operations to be performed on the mode\n     bits, and each operation is applied to the mode bits in the order\n     specified.\n\n     Operations upon the other permissions only (specified by the symbol ``o''\n     by itself), in combination with the perm symbols ``s'' or ``t'', are\n     ignored.\n\n     The ``w'' permission on directories will permit file creation,\n     relocation, and copy into that directory.\tFiles created within the\n     directory itself will inherit its group ID.\n",

        "     ACLs are manipulated using extensions to the symbolic mode grammar.  Each\n     file has one ACL, containing an ordered list of entries.  Each entry\n     refers to a user or group, and grants or denies a set of permissions.  In\n     cases where a user and a group exist with the same name, the user/group\n     name can be prefixed with \"user:\" or \"group:\" in order to specify the\n     type of name.\n\n     If the user or group name contains spaces you can use ':' as the\n     delimiter between name and permission.\n\n     The following permissions are applicable to all filesystem objects:\n\t   delete  Delete the item.  Deletion may be granted by either this\n\t\t   permission on an object or the delete_child right on the\n\t\t   containing directory.\n\t   readattr\n\t\t   Read an object's basic attributes.  This is implicitly\n\t\t   granted if the object can be looked up and not explicitly\n\t\t   denied.\n\t   writeattr\n\t\t   Write an object's basic attributes.\n\t   readextattr\n\t\t   Read extended attributes.\n\t   writeextattr\n\t\t   Write extended attributes.\n\t   readsecurity\n\t\t   Read an object's extended security information (ACL).\n\t   writesecurity\n\t\t   Write an object's security information (ownership, mode,\n\t\t   ACL).\n\t   chown   Change an object's ownership.\n\n     The following permissions are applicable to directories:\n\t   list    List entries.\n\t   search  Look up files by name.\n\t   add_file\n\t\t   Add a file.\n\t   add_subdirectory\n\t\t   Add a subdirectory.\n\t   delete_child\n\t\t   Delete a contained object.  See the file delete permission\n\t\t   above.\n\n     The following permissions are applicable to non-directory filesystem\n     objects:\n\t   read    Open for reading.\n\t   write   Open for writing.\n\t   append  Open for writing, but in a fashion that only allows writes\n\t\t   into areas of the file not previously written.\n\t   execute\n\t\t   Execute the file as a script or program.\n\n     ACL inheritance is controlled with the following permissions words, which\n     may only be applied to directories:\n\t   file_inherit\n\t\t   Inherit to files.\n\t   directory_inherit\n\t\t   Inherit to directories.\n\t   limit_inherit\n\t\t   This flag is only relevant to entries inherited by\n\t\t   subdirectories; it causes the directory_inherit flag to be\n\t\t   cleared in the entry that is inherited, preventing further\n\t\t   nested subdirectories from also inheriting the entry.\n\t   only_inherit\n\t\t   The entry is inherited by created items but not considered\n\t\t   when processing the ACL.\n\n     The ACL manipulation options are as follows:\n\n     +a      The +a mode parses a new ACL entry from the next argument on the\n\t     commandline and inserts it into the canonical location in the\n\t     ACL. If the supplied entry refers to an identity already listed,\n\t     the two entries are combined.\n\n\t     Examples\n\t      # ls -le\n\t      -rw-r--r--+ 1 juser  wheel  0 Apr 28 14:06 file1\n\t      # chmod +a \"admin allow write\" file1\n\t      # ls -le\n\t      -rw-r--r--+ 1 juser  wheel  0 Apr 28 14:06 file1",
