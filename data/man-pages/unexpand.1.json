Backspace\n     characters are preserved into the output and decrement the column count\n     for tab calculations.  The expand utility is useful for pre-processing\n     character files (before sorting, looking at specific columns, etc.) that\n     contain tabs.\n\n     The unexpand utility puts tabs back into the data from the standard input\n     or the named files and writes the result on the standard output.\n\n     The following options are available:\n\n     -a      (unexpand only.)  By default, only leading blanks and tabs are\n\t     reconverted to maximal strings of tabs.  If the -a option is\n\t     given, then tabs are inserted whenever they would compress the\n\t     resultant file by replacing two or more characters.\n\n     -t -Sm tab1, tab2, ..., tabn Sm\n\t     Set tab stops at column positions tab1, tab2, ..., tabn.  If only\n\t     a single number is given, tab stops are set that number of column\n\t     positions apart instead of the default number of 8.\n",
