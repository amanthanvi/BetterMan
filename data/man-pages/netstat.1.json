        "     The netstat command symbolically displays the contents of various\n     network-related data structures.  There are a number of output formats,\n     depending on the options for the information presented.  The first form\n     of the command displays a list of active sockets for each protocol.  The\n     second form presents the contents of one of the other network data\n     structures according to the option selected. Using the third form, with a\n     wait interval specified, netstat will continuously display the\n     information regarding packet traffic on the configured network\n     interfaces.  The fourth form displays statistics for the specified\n     protocol or address family. If a wait interval is specified, the protocol\n     information over the last interval seconds will be displayed.  The fifth\n     form displays per-interface statistics for the specified protocol or\n     address family.  The sixth form displays mbuf(9) statistics.  The seventh\n     form displays routing table for the specified address family.  The eighth\n     form displays routing statistics.\n\n     The options have the following meaning:\n\n     -A    With the default display, show the address of any protocol control\n\t   blocks associated with sockets and the flow hash; used for\n\t   debugging.\n\n     -a    With the default display, show the state of all sockets; normally\n\t   sockets used by server processes are not shown. With the routing\n\t   table display (option -r, as described below), show protocol-cloned\n\t   routes (routes generated by a RTF_PRCLONING parent route); normally\n\t   these routes are not shown.\n\n     -B    Show statistics about bpf(4) devices.  This includes information\n\t   like how many packets have been matched, dropped and received by\n\t   the bpf device, also information about current buffer sizes and\n\t   device states. The option -I show information only for the bpf\n\t   devices bound the specified interface.\n\n     -b    With the interface display (option -i, as described below), show\n\t   the number of bytes in and out.\n\n     -c queue\n\t   With the queue statistics (option -q, as described below), show\n\t   only those for the specified queue.\n\n     -d    With either interface display (option -i or an interval, as\n\t   described below), show the number of dropped packets.\n\n     -f address_family\n\t   Limit statistics or address control block reports to those of the\n\t   specified address family.  The following address families are\n\t   recognized: inet, for AF_INET, inet6, for AF_INET6, unix, for\n\t   AF_UNIX and vsock, for AF_VSOCK.\n\n     -g    Show information related to multicast (group address) membership.\n\t   If the -s option is also present, show extended interface group\n\t   management statistics.  If the -v option is specified, show link-\n\t   layer memberships; they are suppressed by default.  Source lists\n\t   for each group will also be printed.  Specifying -v twice will\n\t   print the control plane timers for each interface and the source\n\t   list counters for each group.  If the -i is specified, only that\n\t   interface will be shown.  If the -f is specified, only information\n\t   for the address family will be displayed.\n\n     -I interface\n\t   Show information about the specified interface; used with a wait\n\t   interval as described below.  If the -s option is present, show\n\t   per-interface protocol statistics on the interface for the\n\t   specified address_family or protocol, or for all protocol families.\n\n     -i    Show the state of interfaces which have been auto-configured\n\t   (interfaces statically configured into a system, but not located at\n\t   boot time are not shown).  If the -a options is also present,\n\t   multicast addresses currently in use are shown for each Ethernet\n\t   interface and for each IP interface address.  Multicast addresses\n\t   are shown on separate lines following the interface address with\n\t   which they are associated.  If the -s option is present, show per-\n\t   interface statistics on all interfaces for the specified\n\t   address_family or protocol, or for all protocol families.\n\n     -L    Show the size of the various listen queues.\tThe first count shows\n\t   the number of unaccepted connections.  The second count shows the\n\t   amount of unaccepted incomplete connections.  The third count is\n\t   the maximum number of queued connections.\n\n     -l    Print full IPv6 address.\n\n     -m    Show statistics recorded by the memory management routines (the\n\t   network stack manages a private pool of memory buffers). More\n\t   detailed information about the buffers, which includes their cache\n\t   related statistics, can be obtained by using -mm or -m -m option.\n\n     -n    Show network addresses as numbers (normally netstat interprets\n\t   addresses and attempts to display them symbolically).  This option\n\t   may be used with any of the display formats.\n\n     -p protocol\n\t   Show statistics about protocol, which is either a well-known name\n\t   for a protocol or an alias for it.  Some protocol names and aliases\n\t   are listed in the file /etc/protocols.  The special protocol name\n\t   “bdg” is used to show bridging statistics.  A null response\n\t   typically means that there are no interesting numbers to report.\n\t   The program will complain if protocol is unknown or if there is no\n\t   statistics routine for it.\n\n     -q    Show network interface send queue statistics.  By default all\n\t   queues are displayed, unless specified with -c.  This option\n\t   requires specifying an interface with -I option.  More detailed\n\t   information about the queues, which includes their queueing\n\t   algorithm related statistics, can be obtained by using -qq or -q -q\n\t   option.\n\n     -r    Show the routing tables.  Use with -a to show protocol-cloned\n\t   routes.  When -s is also present, show routing statistics instead.\n\t   When -l is also present, netstat assumes more columns are there and\n\t   the maximum transmission unit.  More detailed information about the\n\t   route metrics are displayed with -ll for TCP round trip times -lll\n\t   for all metrics.  Use the -z flags to display only entries with\n\t   non-zero RTT values.  (“mtu”) are also displayed.\n\n     -R    Show reachability information.  Use with -i to show link-layer\n\t   reachability information for a given interface.\n\n     -s    Show per-protocol statistics.  If this option is repeated, counters\n\t   with a value of zero are suppressed.  For security reasons, root\n\t   privileges are required to read TCP statistics and in the absence\n\t   of such privileges all TCP counters will be reported as zero.\n\n     -S    Show interface link status and interface state information about\n\t   the specified interface.  This option requires specifying an\n\t   interface with -I option.\n\n     -v    Increase verbosity level.\n\n     -W    In certain displays, avoid truncating addresses even if this causes\n\t   some fields to overflow.\n\n     -w wait\n\t   Show network interface or protocol statistics at intervals of wait\n\t   seconds.\n\n     -x    Show extended link-layer reachability information in addition to\n\t   that shown by the -R flag.\n",
        "     The default display, for active sockets, shows the local and remote\n     addresses, send and receive queue sizes (in bytes), protocol, and the\n     internal state of the protocol.  Address formats are of the form\n     “host.port” or “network.port” if a socket's address specifies a network\n     but no specific host address.  If known, the host and network addresses\n     are displayed symbolically according to the databases /etc/hosts and\n     /etc/networks, respectively.  If a symbolic name for an address is\n     unknown, or if the -n option is specified, the address is printed\n     numerically, according to the address family.  For more information\n     regarding the Internet “dot format”, refer to inet(3)).  Unspecified, or\n     “wildcard”, addresses and ports appear as “*”.\n\n     Internet domain socket states:\n\n     CLOSED: The socket is not in use.\n\n     LISTEN:  The socket is listening for incoming connections.  Unconnected\n     listening sockets like these are only displayed when using the -a option.\n\n     SYN_SENT:\tThe socket is actively trying to establish a connection to a\n     remote peer.\n\n     SYN_RCVD:\tThe socket has passively received a connection request from a\n     remote peer.\n\n     ESTABLISHED:  The socket has an established connection between a local\n     application and a remote peer.\n\n     CLOSE_WAIT:  The socket connection has been closed by the remote peer,\n     and the system is waiting for the local application to close its half of\n     the connection.\n\n     LAST_ACK:\tThe socket connection has been closed by the remote peer, the\n     local application has closed its half of the connection, and the system\n     is waiting for the remote peer to acknowledge the close.\n\n     FIN_WAIT_1:  The socket connection has been closed by the local\n     application, the remote peer has not yet acknowledged the close, and the\n     system is waiting for it to close its half of the connection.\n\n     FIN_WAIT_2:  The socket connection has been closed by the local\n     application, the remote peer has acknowledged the close, and the system\n     is waiting for it to close its half of the connection.\n\n     CLOSING:  The socket connection has been closed by the local application\n     and the remote peer simultaneously, and the remote peer has not yet\n     acknowledged the close attempt of the local application.\n\n     TIME_WAIT:  The socket connection has been closed by the local\n     application, the remote peer has closed its half of the connection, and\n     the system is waiting to be sure that the remote peer received the last\n     acknowledgement.\n\n     The interface display provides a table of cumulative statistics regarding\n     packets transferred, errors, and collisions.  The network addresses of\n     the interface and the maximum transmission unit (“mtu”) are also\n     displayed.\n\n     The routing table display indicates the available routes and their\n     status.  Each route consists of a destination host or network and a\n     gateway to use in forwarding packets.  The flags field shows a collection\n     of information about the route stored as binary choices.  The individual\n     flags are discussed in more detail in the route(8) and route(4) manual\n     pages.  The mapping between letters and flags is:\n\n     1\t     RTF_PROTO1       Protocol specific routing flag #1\n     2\t     RTF_PROTO2       Protocol specific routing flag #2\n     3\t     RTF_PROTO3       Protocol specific routing flag #3\n     B\t     RTF_BLACKHOLE    Just discard packets (during updates)\n     b\t     RTF_BROADCAST    The route represents a broadcast address\n     C\t     RTF_CLONING      Generate new routes on use\n     c\t     RTF_PRCLONING    Protocol-specified generate new routes on use\n     D\t     RTF_DYNAMIC      Created dynamically (by redirect)\n     G\t     RTF_GATEWAY      Destination requires forwarding by intermediary\n     H\t     RTF_HOST\t      Host entry (net otherwise)\n     I\t     RTF_IFSCOPE      Route is associated with an interface scope\n     i\t     RTF_IFREF\t      Route is holding a reference to the interface\n     L\t     RTF_LLINFO       Valid protocol to link address translation\n     M\t     RTF_MODIFIED     Modified dynamically (by redirect)\n     m\t     RTF_MULTICAST    The route represents a multicast address\n     R\t     RTF_REJECT       Host or net unreachable\n     r\t     RTF_ROUTER       Host is a default router\n     S\t     RTF_STATIC       Manually added\n     U\t     RTF_UP\t      Route usable\n     W\t     RTF_WASCLONED    Route was generated as a result of cloning\n     X\t     RTF_XRESOLVE     External daemon translates proto to link address\n     Y\t     RTF_PROXY\t      Proxying; cloned routes will not be scoped\n     g\t     RTF_GLOBAL       Route to a destination of the global internet\n\t\t\t      (policy hint)\n\n     Direct routes are created for each interface attached to the local host;\n     the gateway field for such entries shows the address of the outgoing\n     interface.  The refcnt field gives the current number of active uses of\n     the route.  Connection oriented protocols normally hold on to a single\n     route for the duration of a connection while connectionless protocols\n     obtain a route while sending to the same destination.  The use field\n     provides a count of the number of packets sent using that route.  The\n     interface entry indicates the network interface utilized for the route.\n     A route which is marked with the RTF_IFSCOPE flag is instantiated for the\n     corresponding interface.  A cloning route which is marked with the\n     RTF_PROXY flag will not generate new routes that are associated with its\n     interface scope.\n\n     When netstat is invoked with the -w option and a wait interval argument,\n     it displays a running count of statistics related to network interfaces\n     or protocols.  An obsolete version of this option used a numeric\n     parameter with no option, and is currently supported for backward\n     compatibility.  By default, this display summarizes information for all\n     interfaces.  Information for a specific interface may be displayed with\n     the -I option.\n",

network stack manages a private pool of memory buffers more detailed information about the buffers which includes their cache related statistics can be obtained by using -mm or -m -m option -n show network addresses as numbers normally netstat interprets addresses and attempts to display them symbolically this option may be used with any of the display formats -p show statistics about protocol which is either a well-known name for a protocol or an alias for it some protocol names and aliases are listed in the file etc protocols the special protocol name bdg is used to show bridging statistics a null response typically means that there are no interesting numbers to report the program will complain if protocol is unknown or if there is no statistics routine for it -q show network interface send queue statistics by default all queues are displayed unless specified with -c this option requires specifying an interface with -i option more detailed information about the queues which includes their queueing algorithm related statistics can be obtained by using -qq or -q -q option -r routes when -s is also present show routing statistics instead when -l is also present netstat assumes more columns are there and the maximum transmission unit more detailed information about the route metrics are displayed with -ll for tcp round trip times -lll for all metrics use the -z flags to display only entries with non-zero rtt values mtu are also displayed -r show reachability information use with -i to show link-layer reachability information for a given interface -s with a value of zero are suppressed for security reasons root privileges are required to read tcp statistics and in the absence of such privileges all tcp counters will be reported as zero -s show interface link status and interface state information about the specified interface this option requires specifying an interface with -i option -v -w in certain displays avoid truncating addresses even if this causes some fields to overflow -w show network interface or protocol statistics at intervals of wait seconds -x show extended link-layer reachability information in addition to that shown
