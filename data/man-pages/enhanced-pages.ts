For example “-3 -A 2 -B 3 -y -m 7” would mean: show me the three months around the seventh month, three before that, two after that and the whole year.  ncal will warn about these combinations. A year starts on January 1. Highlighting of dates is disabled if stdout is not a tty. SEE ALSO calendar(3), strftime(3)"

Common substrings in the file are first replaced by 9-bit codes 257 and up. When code 512 is reached, the algorithm switches to 10-bit codes and continues to use more bits until the limit specified by the -b option or its default is reached. After the limit is reached, compress periodically checks the compression ratio.  If it is increasing, compress continues to use the existing code dictionary.  However, if the compression ratio decreases, compress discards the table of substrings and rebuilds it from scratch.  This allows the algorithm to adapt to the next \"block\" of the file. The -b option is unavailable for uncompress since the bits parameter specified during compression is encoded within the output, along with a magic number to ensure that neither decompression of random data nor recompression of compressed data is attempted. The amount of compression obtained depends on the size of the input, the number of bits per code, and the distribution of common substrings. Typically, text such as source code or English is reduced by 50-60%. Compression is generally much better than that achieved by Huffman coding (as used in the historical command pack), or adaptive Huffman coding (as used in the historical command compact), and takes less time to compute. If file is a soft or hard link compress will replace it with a compressed copy of the file pointed to by the link.  The link's target file is left uncompressed. EXIT STATUS The compress and uncompress utilities exit 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs. The compress utility exits 2 if attempting to compress a file would not reduce its size and the -f option was not specified and if no other error occurs."

platform on i386 years are in the range 69-38 representing 1969-2038 on every other platform years 0-68 are accepted and represent 2000-2068 and 69-99 are accepted and represent 1969-1999 in both cases years between 100 and 1900 both included are accepted and interpreted as relative to 1900 of the gregorian calendar with a limit of 138 on i386 and a much higher limit on every other platform

given week day or month this will not adjust the date if the given week day or month is the same as the current one when a date is adjusted to a specific value or in units greater than hours daylight savings time considerations are ignored adjustments in units of hours or less honor daylight saving time so assuming the current date is march 26 0 30 and that the dst adjustment means that the clock goes forward at 01 00 to 02 00 using -v 1h will adjust the date to march 26 2 30 likewise if the date is october 29 0 30 and the dst adjustment means that the clock goes back at 02 00 to 01 00 using -v 3h will be necessary to reach october 29 2 30 when the date is adjusted to a specific value that does not actually exist for example march 26 1 30 bst 2000 in the europe london timezone the date will be silently adjusted forward in units of one hour until it reaches a valid time when the date is adjusted to a specific value that occurs twice for example october 29 1 30 2000 the resulting timezone will be set so that the date matches the earlier of the two times it is not possible to adjust a date to an invalid absolute day so using the switches -v 31d -v 12m will simply fail five months of the year it is therefore usual to set the month before setting the day using -v 12m -v 31d always works adjusting the date by months is inherently ambiguous because a month is a unit of variable length depending on the current date this kind of date adjustment is applied in the most intuitive way first of all date tries to preserve the day of the month if it is impossible because the target month is shorter than the present one the last day of the target month will be the result for example using -v 1m on may 31 will adjust the date to june 30 while using the same option on january 30 will result in the date adjusted to the last day of february this approach is also believed to make the most sense for shell scripting nevertheless be aware that going forth and back by the same number of months may take you to a different date refer to the examples below for further details an operand with a leading plus sign signals a user-defined format string which specifies the format in which to display the date and time the format string may contain any of the conversion specifications described in the strftime 3 manual page and n for nanoseconds as well as any arbitrary text a newline n character is always output after the characters specified by the format string the format string for the default display is if an operand does not have a leading plus sign it is

localtime exists it is interpreted as a time zone definition file usually in the directory hierarchy usr share zoneinfo which contains the time zone definitions from tzdata if the environment variable tz is set its value is interpreted as the name of a time zone definition file either an absolute path or a relative path to a time zone definition in usr share zoneinfo the tz variable overrides etc localtime if the time zone definition file is invalid date silently reverts to utc previous versions of date included the -d set daylight saving time flag and -t set negative time zone offset options but these details are now handled automatically by tzdata modern offsets are positive for time zones ahead of utc and negative for time zones behind utc but like the obsolete -t option the tzdata

When setting values (rather than adjusting them), seconds are in the range 0-59, minutes are in the range 0-59, hours are in the range 0-23, month days are in the range 1-31, week days are in the range 0-6 (Sun-Sat), months are in the range 1-12 (Jan-Dec) and years are in a limited range depending on the platform.

In both cases, years between 100 and 1900 (both included) are accepted and interpreted as relative to 1900 of the Gregorian calendar with a limit of 138 on i386 and a much higher limit on every other platform.

If val is numeric, one of either y, m, w, d, H, M or S must be used to specify which part of the date is to be adjusted. The week day or month may be specified using a name rather than a number.  If a name is used with the plus (or minus) sign, the date will be put forwards (or backwards) to the next (previous) date that matches the given week day or month.  This will not adjust the date, if the given week day or month is the same as the current one. When a date is adjusted to a specific value or in units greater than hours, daylight savings time considerations are ignored. Adjustments in units of hours or less honor daylight saving time. So, assuming the current date is March 26, 0:30 and that the DST adjustment means that the clock goes forward at 01:00 to 02:00, using -v +1H will adjust the date to March 26, 2:30.  Likewise, if the date is October 29, 0:30 and the DST adjustment means that the clock goes back at 02:00 to 01:00, using -v +3H will be necessary to reach October 29, 2:30. When the date is adjusted to a specific value that does not actually exist (for example March 26, 1:30 BST 2000 in the Europe/London timezone), the date will be silently adjusted forward in units of one hour until it reaches a valid time.  When the date is adjusted to a specific value that occurs twice (for example October 29, 1:30 2000), the resulting timezone will be set so that the date matches the earlier of the two times. It is not possible to adjust a date to an invalid absolute day, so using the switches -v 31d -v 12m will simply fail five months of the year.  It is therefore usual to set the month before setting the day; using -v 12m -v 31d always works. Adjusting the date by months is inherently ambiguous because a month is a unit of variable length depending on the current date. This kind of date adjustment is applied in the most intuitive way.  First of all, date tries to preserve the day of the month. If it is impossible because the target month is shorter than the present one, the last day of the target month will be the result. For example, using -v +1m on May 31 will adjust the date to June 30, while using the same option on January 30 will result in the date adjusted to the last day of February.  This approach is also believed to make the most sense for shell scripting. Nevertheless, be aware that going forth and back by the same number of months may take you to a different date. Refer to the examples below for further details. An operand with a leading plus (‘+’) sign signals a user-defined format string which specifies the format in which to display the date and time. The format string may contain any of the conversion specifications described in the strftime(3) manual page and ‘%N’ for nanoseconds, as well as any arbitrary text.  A newline (‘\\n’) character is always output after the characters specified by the format string.  The format string for the default display is “+%+”. If an operand does not have a leading plus sign, it is interpreted as a value for setting the system's notion of the current date and time.  The canonical representation for setting the date and time is: cc\t   Century (either 19 or 20) prepended to the abbreviated year. yy\t   Year in abbreviated form (e.g., 89 for 1989, 06 for 2006). mm\t   Numeric month, a number from 1 to 12. dd\t   Day, a number from 1 to 31. HH\t   Hour, a number from 0 to 23. MM\t   Minutes, a number from 0 to 59. SS\t   Seconds, a number from 0 to 60 (59 plus a potential leap second). Everything but the minutes is optional. date understands the time zone definitions from the IANA Time Zone Database, tzdata, located in /usr/share/zoneinfo.\tTime changes for Daylight Saving Time, standard time, leap seconds and leap years are handled automatically. There are two ways to specify the time zone: If the file or symlink /etc/localtime exists, it is interpreted as a time zone definition file, usually in the directory hierarchy /usr/share/zoneinfo, which contains the time zone definitions from tzdata. If the environment variable TZ is set, its value is interpreted as the name of a time zone definition file, either an absolute path or a relative path to a time zone definition in /usr/share/zoneinfo.  The TZ variable overrides /etc/localtime. If the time zone definition file is invalid, date silently reverts to UTC. Previous versions of date included the -d (set daylight saving time flag) and -t (set negative time zone offset) options, but these details are now handled automatically by tzdata.  Modern offsets are positive for time zones ahead of UTC and negative for time zones behind UTC, but like the obsolete -t option, the tzdata files in the subdirectory /usr/share/zoneinfo/Etc still use an older convention where times ahead of UTC are considered negative."

by diff falls back to a less optimal but faster algorithm patience the patience variant of the myers algorithm attempts to create more aesthetically pleasing diff output by logically grouping lines stone the stone algorithm commonly known as hunt-mcilroy or hunt-szymanski looks for the longest common subsequence between compared files stone encounters worst case performance when there are long common subsequences in large files this can lead to a significant performance impact the stone algorithm is maintained for compatibility the default algorithm is affected by the posixly correct and posix pedantic environment variables when either variable is set the default algorithm will be stone otherwise the diff utility defaults to the myers algorithm but will fall back to the stone algorithm if the input or output options are not supported by the myers implementation -a --text treat all files as ascii text normally diff will simply print binary files differ if files contain binary characters use of this option forces diff to produce a diff -b --ignore-blank-lines causes chunks that include only blank lines to be ignored --color color the additions green and removals red or the value in the diffcolors environment variable the possible values of when are never always and auto auto will use color if the output is a tty and the colorterm environment variable is set to a non- empty string -d --minimal try very hard to produce a diff as small as possible this may consume a lot of processing power and memory when processing large files with many changes -f like -p but display the last line that matches provided pattern -i ignores changes insertions and deletions whose lines match the extended regular expression pattern multiple -i patterns may be specified all

unified diff header -p --show-c-function with unified and context diffs show with each change the first 40 characters of the last line before the context beginning with a letter an underscore or a dollar sign for c and objective-c source code following standard layout conventions this will show the prototype of the function the change applies to -t --initial-tab print a tab rather than a space before the rest of the line for the normal context or unified output formats this makes the alignment of tabs in the line consistent -t --expand-tabs will expand tabs in output lines normal or -c output adds character s to the front of each line which may screw up the indentation of the original source lines and make the output listing difficult to interpret this option will preserve the original source s indentation -w --ignore-all-blanks is similar to -b --ignore-space-change but causes whitespace blanks and tabs to be totally ignored e g if a b will compare equal to if a b -w

subdirectories from comparison whose basenames match pattern patterns are matched using shell-style globbing via fnmatch 3 multiple -x options may be specified if both arguments are directories diff sorts the contents of the directories by name and then runs the regular file diff algorithm producing a change list on text files which are different binary files which differ common subdirectories and files which appear in only one directory are described as such in directory mode only regular files and directories are compared if a non-regular file such as a device special file or fifo is encountered a diagnostic message is printed if only one of file1 and file2 is a directory diff is applied to the non-directory file and the file contained in the directory file with a filename that is

        "description": " Exclude files and subdirectories from comparison whose basenames match pattern.  Patterns are matched using shell-style globbing via fnmatch(3).  Multiple -x options may be specified. If both arguments are directories, diff sorts the contents of the directories by name, and then runs the regular file diff algorithm, producing a change list, on text files which are different.  Binary files which differ, common subdirectories, and files which appear in only one directory are described as such.  In directory mode only regular files and directories are compared.  If a non-regular file such as a device special file or FIFO is encountered, a diagnostic message is printed. If only one of file1 and file2 is a directory, diff is applied to the non-directory file and the file contained in the directory file with a filename that is the same as the last component of the non-directory file. If either file1 or file2 is ‘-’, the standard input is used in its place. Output Style The default (without -e, -c, or -n --rcs options) output contains lines of these forms, where XX, YY, ZZ, QQ are line numbers respective of file order. XXaYY\t  At (the end of) line XX of file1, append the contents of line YY of file2 to make them equal. XXaYY,ZZ\t  Same as above, but append the range of lines, YY through ZZ of file2 to line XX of file1. XXdYY\t  At line XX delete the line.  The value YY tells to which line the change would bring file1 in line with file2. XX,YYdZZ\t  Delete the range of lines XX through YY in file1. XXcYY\t  Change the line XX in file1 to the line YY in file2. XX,YYcZZ\t  Replace the range of specified lines with the line ZZ. XX,YYcZZ,QQ  Replace the range XX,YY from file1 with the range ZZ,QQ from file2. These lines resemble ed(1) subcommands to convert file1 into file2.  The line numbers before the action letters pertain to file1; those after pertain to file2.\tThus, by exchanging a for d and reading the line in reverse order, one can also determine how to convert file2 into file1. As in ed(1), identical pairs (where num1 = num2) are abbreviated as a single number."

of the variables in the environment each name value pair is separated by a new line unless -0 is specified in which case name value pairs are separated by nul both -0 and utility may not be specified together the env utility does not handle values of utility which have an equals sign in their name for obvious reasons this can easily be worked around by interposing the command 1 utility which simply executes its arguments see examples below details of -s split-string processing the processing of the -s option will split the given string into separate arguments based on any space or tab characters found in the string each of those new arguments will then be treated as if it had been specified as a separate argument on the original env command spaces and tabs may be embedded in one of those new arguments by using single or double quotes or backslashes single quotes will escape all non-single quote characters up to the matching single quote double quotes will escape all non-double quote characters up to the matching double quote it is an error if the end of the string is reached before the matching quote character if -s would create a new argument that starts with the character then that argument and the remainder of the string will be ignored the sequence can be used when you want a new argument to start with a character without causing the remainder of the string to be skipped while processing the string value -s processing will treat certain character combinations as escape sequences which represent some action to take the character escape sequences are in backslash notation the characters and their meanings are as follows c ignore the remaining characters in the string this must not appear inside a double-quoted string f replace with a form-feed character n replace with a new-line character r replace with a carriage return character t replace with a tab character v replace with a vertical tab character replace with a character this would be useful when you need a as the first character in one of the arguments created by splitting apart the given string replace with a character if this is found inside of a double-quoted string then replace it with a single blank if this is found outside of a quoted string then treat this as the separator character between new arguments in the original string replace with a double quote character replace with a single quote character replace with a backslash character the sequences for single-quote and backslash are the only sequences which are recognized inside of a single-quoted string the other sequences have no special meaning inside a single-quoted string all escape sequences are recognized inside of a double-quoted string it is an error if a single character is followed by a character other than the ones listed above the processing of -s also supports substitution of values from environment variables to do this the name of the environment variable must be inside of such as somevar the common shell syntax of somevar is not supported all values substituted will be the values of the environment variables as they were when the env utility was originally invoked those values will not be checked for any of the escape sequences as described above and any settings of name value will not effect the values used for substitution in -s processing also -s processing cannot reference the value of the special parameters which are defined by most shells for instance -s cannot recognize special parameters such as or if they appear inside the given string use in shell-scripts the env utility is often used as the interpreter on the first line of interpreted scripts as described in execve 2 note that the first line of an interpreted script is parsed differently on darwin than it is on many other common systems the first line will be split into separate arguments based on any whitespace space or tab characters found in the line so if a script named usr local bin someport has a first line of usr local bin php -n -q -dsafe mode 0 then the usr local bin php program will be started with the arguments of arg 0 usr local bin php arg 1 -n arg 2 -q arg 3 -dsafe mode 0 arg 4 usr local bin someport plus any arguments the user specified when executing someport however this processing of multiple options on the line is not the way many other operating system parse the first line of an interpreted script notably the same first line on other systems will result in usr local bin php being started with the arguments of arg 0 usr local bin php arg 1 -n -q -dsafe mode 0 arg 2 usr local bin someport plus any arguments the user specified as a result uses of the -s option like this usr bin env -s usr local bin php -n -q -dsafe mode 0 will behave differently than expected on darwin which will instead parse the original version of this first line as if it were executed directly in a shell somevar is not supported all values substituted will be the values of the environment variables as they were when the env utility was name utility argument description macos 15 5 october 8 2024 macos 15 5",

        "flag": "-v",
        "description": "Print verbose information for each step of processing done by the env utility.  Additional information will be printed if -v is specified multiple times. The above options are only recognized when they are specified before any name=value options. If no utility is specified, env prints out the names and values of the variables in the environment.  Each name/value pair is separated by a new line unless -0 is specified, in which case name/value pairs are separated by NUL.  Both -0 and utility may not be specified together. The env utility does not handle values of utility which have an equals sign (‘=’) in their name, for obvious reasons.  This can easily be worked around by interposing the command(1) utility, which simply executes its arguments; see EXAMPLES below. Details of -S (split-string) processing The processing of the -S option will split the given string into separate arguments based on any space or <tab> characters found in the string. Each of those new arguments will then be treated as if it had been specified as a separate argument on the original env command. Spaces and tabs may be embedded in one of those new arguments by using single (“'”) or double (‘\"’) quotes, or backslashes (‘\\’).  Single quotes will escape all non-single quote characters, up to the matching single quote.  Double quotes will escape all non-double quote characters, up to the matching double quote.  It is an error if the end of the string is reached before the matching quote character. If -S would create a new argument that starts with the ‘#’ character, then that argument and the remainder of the string will be ignored.  The ‘\\#’ sequence can be used when you want a new argument to start with a ‘#’ character, without causing the remainder of the string to be skipped. While processing the string value, -S processing will treat certain character combinations as escape sequences which represent some action to take.  The character escape sequences are in backslash notation.  The characters and their meanings are as follows: \\c\t   Ignore the remaining characters in the string.  This must not appear inside a double-quoted string. \\f\t   Replace with a <form-feed> character. \\n\t   Replace with a <new-line> character. \\r\t   Replace with a <carriage return> character. \\t\t   Replace with a <tab> character. \\v\t   Replace with a <vertical tab> character. \\#\t   Replace with a ‘#’ character.  This would be useful when you need a ‘#’ as the first character in one of the arguments created by splitting apart the given string. \\$\t   Replace with a ‘$’ character. \\_\t   If this is found inside of a double-quoted string, then replace it with a single blank.  If this is found outside of a quoted string, then treat this as the separator character between new arguments in the original string. \\\"\t   Replace with a <double quote> character. \\´\t   Replace with a <single quote> character. \\\\\t   Replace with a backslash character. The sequences for <single-quote> and backslash are the only sequences which are recognized inside of a single-quoted string.  The other sequences have no special meaning inside a single-quoted string.  All escape sequences are recognized inside of a double-quoted string.\tIt is an error if a single ‘\\’ character is followed by a character other than the ones listed above. The processing of -S also supports substitution of values from environment variables.  To do this, the name of the environment variable must be inside of ‘${}’, such as: ${SOMEVAR}.  The common shell syntax of $SOMEVAR is not supported.  All values substituted will be the values of the environment variables as they were when the env utility was originally invoked.  Those values will not be checked for any of the escape sequences as described above.  And any settings of name=value will not effect the values used for substitution in -S processing. Also, -S processing cannot reference the value of the special parameters which are defined by most shells.\tFor instance, -S cannot recognize special parameters such as: ‘$*’, ‘$@’, ‘$#’, ‘$?’ or ‘$$’ if they appear inside the given string. Use in shell-scripts The env utility is often used as the interpreter on the first line of interpreted scripts, as described in execve(2). Note that the ‘#!’ (first line) of an interpreted script is parsed differently on Darwin than it is on many other common systems.  The first line will be split into separate arguments based on any whitespace (space or ⟨tab⟩ characters) found in the line.  So, if a script named /usr/local/bin/someport has a first line of: #!/usr/local/bin/php -n -q -dsafe_mode=0 then the /usr/local/bin/php program will be started with the arguments of: arg[0] = '/usr/local/bin/php' arg[1] = '-n' arg[2] = '-q' arg[3] = '-dsafe_mode=0' arg[4] = '/usr/local/bin/someport' plus any arguments the user specified when executing someport.  However, this processing of multiple options on the ‘#!’ line is not the way many other operating system parse the first line of an interpreted script. Notably, the same first line on other systems will result in /usr/local/bin/php being started with the arguments of: arg[0] = '/usr/local/bin/php' arg[1] = '-n -q -dsafe_mode=0' arg[2] = '/usr/local/bin/someport' plus any arguments the user specified.  As a result, uses of the -S option like this: #!/usr/bin/env -S /usr/local/bin/php -n -q -dsafe_mode=0 will behave differently than expected on Darwin, which will instead parse the original version of this first line as if it were executed directly in a shell."

prompt that looks like so fdisk 0 this prompt has two important pieces of information for you it will tell you if the in-memory copy of the boot block has been modified or not if it has been modified the prompt will change to look like fdisk 0 the second piece of information pertains to the number given in the prompt this number specifies the disk offset of the currently selected boot block you are editing this number could be something different that zero when you are editing extended partitions the list of commands and their explanations are given below help display a list of commands that fdisk understands in the interactive edit mode manual display this manual page reinit initialize the currently selected in-memory copy of the boot block auto partition the disk with one of the

        "description": " Specify the number of bytes per disk block. The DOS fdisk program can be used to divide space on the disk into partitions and set one active.  This fdisk program serves a similar purpose to the DOS program.  When called with no special flags, it prints the MBR partition table of the specified device, i.e., # fdisk fd0 Disk: fd0\t geometry: 80/2/18 [2880 sectors] Offset: 0\t Signature: 0xAA55 Starting\t  Ending #: id  cyl  hd sec -\tcyl  hd sec [\t  start -\tsize] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *1: A6    0   0   1 -\t 79   1  18 [\t      0 -\t2880] OpenBSD 2: 00    0   0   0 -\t  0   0   0 [\t      0 -\t   0] unused 3: A7    0   0   2 -\t 79   1  18 [\t      1 -\t2879] NEXTSTEP 4: 00    0   0   0 -\t  0   0   0 [\t      0 -\t   0] unused The geometry displayed is a synthetic geometry unless another geometry has been selected using the -c, -h, -s, -S, and -b options.  In the future, fdisk will read the BIOS geometry from the IOKit registry. In this example, the disk is divided into two partitions that happen to fill the disk.  The first partition overlaps the third partition.\t(Used for debugging purposes.) #\t\t Number of partition table entry.  A “*” denotes the bootable partition. id \t System identifier.  OpenBSD reserves the magic number 166 decimal (A6 in hex).  If no 166 partition is found, it will use an older FreeBSD partition (with a magic number of 165 or A5 in hex). cyl/hd/sec  These fields provide the starting and ending address of the partition in BIOS geometry start/size  These fields provide the starting sector and size in sectors of the partition in linear block addresses. NOTE: The sectors field is “1 based”, and the start field is “0 based”. The CHS values may need to be in the BIOS's geometry for older systems to be able to boot and use the drive correctly; most modern systems prefer the starting sector and size in preference to the CHS values. The -i flag is used to indicate that the partition data is to be initialized.  In this mode, fdisk will completely overwrite the primary MBR and partition table, either using the default MBR template, or the one specified by the -f flag. In the default template, partition number 1 will be configured as a Darwin boot partition spanning from cylinder 0, head 1, sector 1, and extending for 8 megabytes.  Partition number 2 will be configured as a Darwin HFS partition spanning the rest of the disk.  This mode is designed to initialize an MBR the very first time, or when it has been corrupted beyond repair. You can specify other default partition styles with the -a flag.  The available styles are: boothfs\t Creates an 8Mb boot partition (type AB hex) and makes the rest of the disk a Darwin HFS partition (type AF hex). hfs\t Makes the entire disk one HFS+ partition (type AF hex). dos\t Makes the entire disk one DOS partition (type 0C hex). raid\t Makes the entire disk one type AC hex partition. The -u flag is used to update the MBR code on a given drive.  The MBR code extends from offset 0x000 to the start of the partition table at offset 0x1BE.  It is similar to the -i flag, except the existing partition table is preserved. This is useful for writing new MBR code onto an existing drive, and is equivalent to the DOS command “FDISK /MBR”.  Note that this option will overwrite the NT disk signature, if present.  The -u and -i flags may not be specified together. The flag -e is used to modify a partition table using a interactive edit mode of the fdisk program.  This mode is designed to allow you to change any partition on the drive you choose, including extended partitions.  It is a very powerful mode, but is safe as long as you do not execute the write command, or answer in the negative (the default) when fdisk asks you about writing out changes. COMMAND MODE When you first enter this mode, you are presented with a prompt, that looks like so: fdisk: 0>.\tThis prompt has two important pieces of information for you.  It will tell you if the in-memory copy of the boot block has been modified or not.  If it has been modified, the prompt will change to look like: fdisk:*0>.  The second piece of information pertains to the number given in the prompt.  This number specifies the disk offset of the currently selected boot block you are editing.  This number could be something different that zero when you are editing extended partitions.  The list of commands and their explanations are given below. help    Display a list of commands that fdisk understands in the interactive edit mode. manual  Display this manual page. reinit  Initialize the currently selected, in-memory copy of the boot block. auto    Partition the disk with one of the automatic partition styles. disk    Display the current drive geometry that fdisk has probed.\tYou are given a chance to edit it if you wish. edit    Edit a given table entry in the memory copy of the current boot block.  You may edit either in BIOS geometry mode, or in sector offsets and sizes. setpid  Change the partition identifier of the given partition table entry.  This command is particularly useful for reassigning an existing partition to OpenBSD. flag    Make the given partition table entry bootable.  Only one entry can be marked bootable.  If you wish to boot from an extended partition, you will need to mark the partition table entry for the extended partition as bootable. update  Update the machine code in the memory copy of the currently selected boot block.  Note that this option will overwrite the NT disk signature, if present. select  Select and load into memory the boot block pointed to by the extended partition table entry in the current boot block. print   Print the currently selected in-memory copy of the boot block and its MBR table to the terminal. write   Write the in-memory copy of the boot block to disk.  You will be asked to confirm this operation. exit    Exit the current level of fdisk, either returning to the previously selected in-memory copy of a boot block, or exiting the program if there is none. quit    Exit the current level of fdisk, either returning to the previously selected in-memory copy of a boot block, or exiting the program if there is none.  Unlike exit it does write the modified block out. abort   Quit program without saving current changes."

subsequent non-absolute -c path is interpreted relative to the preceding -c path if path is present but empty e g -c then the current working directory is left unchanged this option affects options that expect path name like --git-dir and --work-tree in that their interpretations of the path names would be made relative to the working directory caused by the -c option for example the following invocations are equivalent git --git-dir a git --work-tree b -c c status git --git-dir c a git --work-tree c b status --config-env like -c name value give configuration variable name a value where envvar is the name of an environment variable from which to retrieve the value unlike -c there is no shortcut for directly setting the value to an empty string instead the environment variable itself must be set to the empty string it is an error if the envvar does not exist in the environment envvar may not contain an equals sign to avoid ambiguity with name containing one this is useful for cases where you want to pass transitory configuration options to git but are doing so on os s where other processes might be able to read your cmdline e g proc self cmdline but not your environ e g proc self environ that behavior is the default on linux but may not be on your system note that this might add security for variables such as http extraheader where the sensitive information is part of the value but not e g url base insteadof where the sensitive information can be part of the key --exec-path path to wherever your core git programs are installed this can also be controlled by setting the git exec path environment variable if no path is given git will print the current setting and then exit --html-path print the path without trailing slash where git s html documentation is installed and exit --man-path print the manpath see man 1 for the man pages for this version of git and exit --info-path print the path where the info files documenting this version of git are installed and exit -p pipe all output into less or if set pager if standard output is a terminal this overrides the pager cmd configuration options see the configuration mechanism section below --git-dir set the path to the repository git directory this can also be controlled by setting the git dir environment variable it can be an absolute path or relative path to current working directory specifying the location of the git directory using this option or git dir environment variable turns off the repository discovery that tries to find a directory with git subdirectory which is how the repository and the top-level of the working tree are discovered and tells git that you are at the top level of the working tree if you are not at the top-level directory of the working tree you should tell git where the top-level of the working tree is with the --work-tree path option or git work tree environment variable if you just want to run git as if it was started in path then use git -c path --work-tree set the path to the working tree it can be an absolute path or a path relative to the current working directory this can also be controlled by setting the git work tree environment variable and the core worktree configuration variable see core worktree in git- config 1 for a more detailed discussion --namespace set the git namespace see gitnamespaces 7 for more details

This is useful for cases where you want to pass transitory configuration options to git, but are doing so on OS’s where other processes might be able to read your cmdline (e.g. /proc/self/cmdline), but not your environ (e.g. /proc/self/environ).

Reset, restore and revert There are three commands with similar names: git reset, git restore and git revert. •   git-revert(1) is about making a new commit that reverts the changes made by other commits. •   git-restore(1) is about restoring files in the working tree from either the index or another commit. This command does not update your branch. The command can also be used to restore files in the index from another commit. •   git-reset(1) is about updating your branch, moving the tip in order to add or remove commits from the branch. This operation changes the commit history. git reset can also be used to restore the index, overlapping with git restore. LOW-LEVEL COMMANDS (PLUMBING) Although Git includes its own porcelain layer, its low-level commands are sufficient to support development of alternative porcelains. Developers of such porcelains might start by reading about git-update- index(1) and git-read-tree(1). The interface (input, output, set of options and the semantics) to these low-level commands are meant to be a lot more stable than Porcelain level commands, because these commands are primarily for scripted use. The interface to Porcelain commands on the other hand are subject to change in order to improve the end user experience. The following description divides the low-level commands into commands that manipulate objects (in the repository, index, and working tree), commands that interrogate and compare objects, and commands that move objects and references between repositories. Manipulation commands git-apply(1) Apply a patch to files and/or to the index. git-checkout-index(1) Copy files from the index to the working tree. git-commit-graph(1) Write and verify Git commit-graph files. git-commit-tree(1) Create a new commit object. git-hash-object(1) Compute object ID and optionally creates a blob from a file. git-index-pack(1) Build pack index file for an existing packed archive. git-merge-file(1) Run a three-way file merge. git-merge-index(1) Run a merge for files needing merging. git-mktag(1) Creates a tag object with extra validation. git-mktree(1) Build a tree-object from ls-tree formatted text. git-multi-pack-index(1) Write and verify multi-pack-indexes. git-pack-objects(1) Create a packed archive of objects. git-prune-packed(1) Remove extra objects that are already in pack files. git-read-tree(1) Reads tree information into the index. git-symbolic-ref(1) Read, modify and delete symbolic refs. git-unpack-objects(1) Unpack objects from a packed archive. git-update-index(1) Register file contents in the working tree to the index. git-update-ref(1) Update the object name stored in a ref safely. git-write-tree(1) Create a tree object from the current index. Interrogation commands git-cat-file(1) Provide content or type and size information for repository objects. git-cherry(1) Find commits yet to be applied to upstream. git-diff-files(1) Compares files in the working tree and the index. git-diff-index(1) Compare a tree to the working tree or index. git-diff-tree(1) Compares the content and mode of blobs found via two tree objects. git-for-each-ref(1) Output information on each ref. git-for-each-repo(1) Run a Git command on a list of repositories. git-get-tar-commit-id(1) Extract commit ID from an archive created using git-archive. git-ls-files(1) Show information about files in the index and the working tree. git-ls-remote(1) List references in a remote repository. git-ls-tree(1) List the contents of a tree object. git-merge-base(1) Find as good common ancestors as possible for a merge. git-name-rev(1) Find symbolic names for given revs. git-pack-redundant(1) Find redundant pack files. git-rev-list(1) Lists commit objects in reverse chronological order. git-rev-parse(1) Pick out and massage parameters. git-show-index(1) Show packed archive index. git-show-ref(1) List references in a local repository. git-unpack-file(1) Creates a temporary file with a blob’s contents. git-var(1) Show a Git logical variable. git-verify-pack(1) Validate packed Git archive files. In general, the interrogate commands do not touch the files in the working tree.

mechanism used is not ethernet-specific the address addr is specified as a series of colon-separated hex digits if the interface is already up when this option is used it will be briefly brought down and then brought back up again in order to ensure that the receive filter in the underlying ethernet hardware is properly reprogrammed media type if the driver supports the media selection system set the media type of the interface to type some interfaces support the mutually exclusive use of one of several different physical media connectors for example a 10mbit s ethernet interface might support the use of either aui or twisted pair connectors setting the media type to 10base5 aui would change the currently active connector to the aui port setting it to 10baset utp would activate twisted pair refer to the interfaces driver specific documentation or man page for a complete list of the available types mediaopt opts if the driver supports the media selection system set the specified media

unit of the interface to n default is interface specific the mtu is used to limit the size of packets that are transmitted on an interface not all interfaces support setting the mtu and some interfaces have range restrictions netmask mask inet only specify how much of the address to reserve for subdividing networks into sub-networks the mask includes the network part of the local address and the subnet part which is taken from the host field of the address the mask can be specified as a single hexadecimal number with a leading 0x with a dot-notation internet address or with a pseudo-network name listed in the network table networks 5 the mask contains 1 s for the bit positions in the 32-bit address which are to be used for the network and subnet parts and 0 s for the host part the mask should contain at least the standard network portion and the subnet field should be contiguous with the network portion the netmask can also be specified in cidr notation after the address see the address option above for more information prefixlen len inet6 only specify that len bits are reserved for subdividing networks into sub-networks the len must be integer and for syntactical reason it must be between 0 to 128 it is almost always 64 under the current ipv6 assignment rule if the parameter is omitted 64 is used the prefix can also be specified using the slash

specific to vlan interfaces vlan vlan tag set the vlan tag value to vlan tag this value is a 16-bit number which is used to create an 802 1q vlan header for packets sent from the vlan 4 interface note that vlan and vlandev must both be set at the same time vlandev iface associate the physical interface iface with a vlan 4 interface packets transmitted through the vlan 4 interface will be diverted to the specified physical interface iface with 802 1q vlan encapsulation packets with 802 1q encapsulation received by the parent interface with the correct vlan tag will be diverted to the associated vlan 4 pseudo-interface the vlan 4 interface is assigned a copy of the parent interface s flags and the parent s ethernet address the vlandev and vlan must both be set at the same time if the vlan 4 interface already has a physical interface associated with it this command will fail to change the association to another physical interface the existing association must be cleared first note if the hardware tagging capability is set on the parent interface the vlan 4 pseudo interface s behavior changes the vlan 4 interface recognizes that the parent interface supports insertion and extraction of vlan tags on its own usually in firmware and that it should pass packets to and from the parent unaltered -vlandev if the driver is a vlan 4 pseudo device disassociate the parent interface from it this breaks the link between the vlan 4 interface and its parent clears its vlan tag flags and its link address and shuts the interface down the iface argument is useless and hence deprecated tbr rate

Included for Solaris compatibility. unplumb Another name for the destroy parameter.  Included for Solaris compatibility. metric n Set the routing metric of the interface to n, default 0.  The routing metric may be used by routing protocols.  Higher metrics have the effect of making a route less favorable; metrics are counted as additional hops to the destination network or host. mtu n   Set the maximum transmission unit of the interface to n, default is interface specific.  The MTU is used to limit the size of packets that are transmitted on an interface.  Not all interfaces support setting the MTU, and some interfaces have range restrictions. netmask mask (Inet only.)  Specify how much of the address to reserve for subdividing networks into sub-networks.  The mask includes the network part of the local address and the subnet part, which is taken from the host field of the address.\tThe mask can be specified as a single hexadecimal number with a leading ‘0x’, with a dot-notation Internet address, or with a pseudo-network name listed in the network table networks(5).  The mask contains 1's for the bit positions in the 32-bit address which are to be used for the network and subnet parts, and 0's for the host part. The mask should contain at least the standard network portion, and the subnet field should be contiguous with the network portion. The netmask can also be specified in CIDR notation after the address.  See the address option above for more information. prefixlen len (Inet6 only.)  Specify that len bits are reserved for subdividing networks into sub-networks.  The len must be integer, and for syntactical reason it must be between 0 to 128.

A hard link to a file is indistinguishable from the original directory entry; any changes to a file are effectively independent of the name used to reference the file. Directories may not be hardlinked, and hard links may not span file systems. A symbolic link contains the name of the file to which it is linked.  The referenced file is used when an open(2) operation is performed on the link.  A stat(2) on a symbolic link will return the linked-to file; an lstat(2) must be done to obtain information about the link.  The readlink(2) call may be used to read the contents of a symbolic link. Symbolic links may span file systems and may refer to directories. Given one or two arguments, ln creates a link to an existing file source_file.  If target_file is given, the link has that name; target_file may also be a directory in which to place the link; otherwise it is placed in the current directory.  If only the directory is specified, the link will be made to the last component of source_file. Given more than two arguments, ln makes links in target_dir to all the named source files.  The links made will have the same name as the files being linked to. When the utility is called as link, exactly two arguments must be supplied, neither of which may specify a directory.  No options may be supplied in this simple mode of operation, which performs a link(2) operation using the two passed arguments."

The -B, -b, -w, and -q options all override each other; the last one specified determines the format used for non-printable characters. The -H, -L and -P options all override each other (either partially or fully); they are applied in the order specified. By default, ls lists one entry per line to standard output; the exceptions are to terminals or when the -C or -x options are specified. File information is displayed with one or more ⟨blank⟩s separating the information associated with the -i, -s, and -l options. The Long Format If the -l option is given, the following information is displayed for each file: file mode, number of links, owner name, group name, number of bytes in the file, abbreviated month, day-of-month file was last modified, hour file last modified, minute file last modified, and the pathname.\tIf the file or directory has extended attributes, the permissions field printed by the -l option is followed by a '@' character.  Otherwise, if the file or directory has extended security information (such as an access control list), the permissions field printed by the -l option is followed by a '+' character.  If the -% option is given, a '%' character follows the permissions field for dataless files and directories, possibly replacing the '@' or '+' character. If the modification time of the file is more than 6 months in the past or future, and the -D or -T are not specified, then the year of the last modification is displayed in place of the hour and minute fields. If the owner or group names are not a known user or group name, or the -n option is given, the numeric ID's are displayed. If the file is a character special or block special file, the device number for the file is displayed in the size field.  If the file is a symbolic link the pathname of the linked-to file is preceded by “->”. The listing of a directory's contents is preceded by a labeled total number of blocks used in the file system by the files which are listed as the directory's contents (which may or may not include . and .. and other files which start with a dot, depending on other options). The default block size is 512 bytes.  The block size may be set with option -k or environment variable BLOCKSIZE.  Numbers of blocks in the output will have been rounded up so the numbers of bytes is at least as many as used by the corresponding file system blocks (which might have a different size). The file mode printed under the -l option consists of the entry type and the permissions.  The entry type character describes the type of file, as follows: -\t Regular file. b\t Block special file. c\t Character special file. d\t Directory. l\t Symbolic link. p\t FIFO. s\t Socket. w\t Whiteout. The next three fields are three characters each: owner permissions, group permissions, and other permissions.  Each field has three character positions: 1.\tIf r, the file is readable; if -, it is not readable. 2.\tIf w, the file is writable; if -, it is not writable. 3.\tThe first of the following that applies: S     If in the owner permissions, the file is not executable and set-user-ID mode is set.  If in the group permissions, the file is not executable and set-group-ID mode is set. s     If in the owner permissions, the file is executable and set-user-ID mode is set.  If in the group permissions, the file is executable and setgroup-ID mode is set. x     The file is executable or the directory is searchable. -     The file is neither readable, writable, executable, nor set-user-ID nor set-group-ID mode, nor sticky.  (See below.) These next two apply only to the third character in the last group (other permissions). T     The sticky bit is set (mode 1000), but not execute or search permission.  (See chmod(1) or sticky(7).) t     The sticky bit is set (mode 1000), and is searchable or executable.  (See chmod(1) or sticky(7).) The next field contains a plus (‘+’) character if the file has an ACL, or a space (‘ ’) if it does not.  The ls utility does not show the actual ACL unless the -e option is used in conjunction with the -l option."

This is also the default.\tIt can be avoided with the noasync option. force   The same as -f; forces the revocation of write access when trying to downgrade a filesystem mount status from read-write to read-only. noasync This filesystem should not force all I/O to be written asynchronously. noauto  This filesystem should be skipped when mount is run with the -a flag. nodev   Do not interpret character or block special devices on the file system.  This option is useful for a server that has file systems containing special devices for architectures other than its own. noexec  Do not allow execution of any binaries on the mounted file system.  This option is useful for a server that has file systems containing binaries for architectures other than its own. noowners Ignore the ownership field for the entire volume.\tThis causes all objects to appear as owned by user ID 99 and group ID 99.  User ID 99 is interpreted as the current effective user ID, while group ID 99 is used directly and translates to ``unknown''. nosuid  Do not allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier bits to take effect. rdonly  The same as -r; mount the file system read-only (even the super-user may not write it). sync    All I/O to the file system should be done synchronously. update  The same as -u; indicate that the status of an already mounted file system should be changed. union   Causes the namespace to appear as the union of directories of the mounted filesystem with corresponding directories in the underlying filesystem.\tLookups will be done in the mounted filesystem first.  If those operations fail due to a non-existent file the underlying directory is then accessed. noatime Do not update the file access time when reading from a file.  This option is useful on file systems where there are large numbers of files and performance is more critical than updating the file access time (which is rarely ever important). strictatime Always update the file access time when reading from a file. Without this option the filesystem may default to a less strict update mode, where some access time updates are skipped for performance reasons. This option could be ignored if it is not supported by the filesystem. nobrowse This option indicates that the mount point should not be visible via the GUI (i.e., appear on the Desktop as a separate volume). nofollow This option indicates that in the course of the mount system call, the kernel should not follow any symlinks that may be present in the provided mount-on directory.

without the -w flag the default is no timeout -x requests that nc should use the specified protocol when talking to the proxy server supported protocols are 4 socks v 4 5 socks v 5 and connect https proxy if the protocol is not specified socks version 5 is used -x requests that nc should connect to hostname using a proxy at proxy address and port if port is not specified the well-known port for the proxy protocol is used 1080 for socks 3128 for https --apple-delegate-pid requests that nc should delegate the socket for the specified pid it is an error to use this option in conjunction with the --apple-delegate-uuid requests that nc should delegate the socket for the specified uuid it is an error to use this option in conjunction with the --apple-delegate-uuid requests that nc should delegate the socket for the specified uuid it is an error to use this option in conjunction with the --apple-delegate-pid requests that nc should delegate the socket for the specified pid it is an error to use this option in conjunction with the --apple-ext-bk-idle requests that nc marks its socket for extended background idle time when the process becomes suspended --apple-nowakefromsleep when the parameter n is greater than 0 requests that nc marks its socket to exclude the local port from the list of opened ports that is queried by drivers when the system goes to sleep when n is greater than 1 set the socket option that generates the kev socket closed kernel event when the socket gets closed --apple-ecn requests that nc marks to use the socket option tcp ecn mode to set the ecn mode default enable disable hostname can be a numerical ip address or a symbolic hostname unless the -n option is given in general a hostname must be specified unless the -l option is given in which case the local host is used port s can be single integers or ranges ranges are in the form nn-mm in general a destination port must be specified unless the -u option is given in which case a socket must be specified client server model it is quite simple to build a very basic client server model using nc on one console start nc listening on a specific port for a connection for example nc -l 1234 nc is now listening on port 1234 for a connection on a second console or a second machine connect to the machine and port being listened on nc 127 0 0 1 1234 there should now be a connection between the ports anything typed at the second console will be concatenated to the first and vice-versa after the connection has been set up nc does not really care which side is being used as a server and which side is being used as a client the connection may be terminated using an eof d data transfer the example in the previous section can be expanded to build a basic data transfer model any information input into one end of the connection will be output to the other end and input and output can be easily captured in order to emulate file transfer start by using nc to listen on a specific port with output captured into a file nc -l 1234 filename out using a second machine connect to the listening nc process feeding it the file which is to be transferred nc host example com 1234 filename in after the file has been transferred the connection will close automatically talking to servers it is sometimes useful to talk to servers by hand rather than through a user interface it can aid in troubleshooting when it might be necessary to verify what data a server is sending in response to commands issued by the client for example to retrieve the home page of a web site echo -n get http 1 0 r n r n nc host example com 80 note that this also displays the headers sent by the web server they can be filtered using a tool such as sed 1 if necessary more complicated examples can be built up when the user knows the format of requests required by the server as another example an email may be submitted to an smtp server using nc localhost 25 eof helo host example com mail from user host example com rcpt to user2 host example com data body of email quit eof port scanning it may be useful to know which ports are open and running services on a target machine the -z flag can be used to tell nc to report open ports rather than initiate a connection for example nc -z host example com 20-30 connection to host example com 22 port tcp ssh succeeded connection to host example com 25 port tcp smtp succeeded the port range was specified to limit the search to ports 20 - 30 alternatively it might be useful to know which server software is running and which versions this information is often contained within the greeting banners in order to retrieve these it is necessary to first make a connection and then break the connection when the banner has been retrieved this can be accomplished by specifying a small timeout with the -w flag or perhaps by issuing a quit command to the server echo quit nc host example com 20-30 ssh-1 99-openssh 3 6 1p2 protocol mismatch 220 host

In general, a destination port must be specified, unless the -U option is given (in which case a socket must be specified). CLIENT/SERVER MODEL It is quite simple to build a very basic client/server model using nc. On one console, start nc listening on a specific port for a connection. For example: $ nc -l 1234 nc is now listening on port 1234 for a connection.  On a second console (or a second machine), connect to the machine and port being listened on: $ nc 127.0.0.1 1234 There should now be a connection between the ports.  Anything typed at the second console will be concatenated to the first, and vice-versa. After the connection has been set up, nc does not really care which side is being used as a ‘server’ and which side is being used as a ‘client’. The connection may be terminated using an EOF (‘^D’). DATA TRANSFER The example in the previous section can be expanded to build a basic data transfer model.  Any information input into one end of the connection will be output to the other end, and input and output can be easily captured in order to emulate file transfer. Start by using nc to listen on a specific port, with output captured into a file: $ nc -l 1234 > filename.out Using a second machine, connect to the listening nc process, feeding it the file which is to be transferred: $ nc host.example.com 1234 < filename.in After the file has been transferred, the connection will close automatically. TALKING TO SERVERS It is sometimes useful to talk to servers “by hand” rather than through a user interface.  It can aid in troubleshooting, when it might be necessary to verify what data a server is sending in response to commands issued by the client.  For example, to retrieve the home page of a web site: $ echo -n \"GET / HTTP/1.0\\r\\n\\r\\n\" | nc host.example.com 80 Note that this also displays the headers sent by the web server.  They can be filtered, using a tool such as sed(1), if necessary. More complicated examples can be built up when the user knows the format of requests required by the server.  As another example, an email may be submitted to an SMTP server using: $ nc localhost 25 << EOF HELO host.example.com MAIL FROM: <user@host.example.com> RCPT TO: <user2@host.example.com> DATA Body of email. . QUIT EOF PORT SCANNING It may be useful to know which ports are open and running services on a target machine.  The -z flag can be used to tell nc to report open ports, rather than initiate a connection.  For example: $ nc -z host.example.com 20-30 Connection to host.example.com 22 port [tcp/ssh] succeeded! Connection to host.example.com 25 port [tcp/smtp] succeeded! The port range was specified to limit the search to ports 20 - 30. Alternatively, it might be useful to know which server software is running, and which versions.  This information is often contained within the greeting banners.  In order to retrieve these, it is necessary to first make a connection, and then break the connection when the banner has been retrieved.  This can be accomplished by specifying a small timeout with the -w flag, or perhaps by issuing a \"QUIT\" command to the server: $ echo \"QUIT\" | nc host.example.com 20-30 SSH-1.99-OpenSSH_3.6.1p2 Protocol mismatch. 220 host.example.com IMS SMTP Receiver Version 0.84 Ready"

    "synopsis": "npm Note: This command is unaware of workspaces. Version 10.2.4 Description npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. It puts modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency conflicts intelligently. It is extremely configurable to support a variety of use cases. Most commonly, you use it to publish, discover, install, and develop node programs. Run npm help to get a list of available commands. Important npm comes preconfigured to use npm's public registry at https://registry.npmjs.org by default. Use of the npm public registry is subject to terms of use available at https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/terms. You can configure npm to use any compatible registry you like, and even run your own registry. Use of someone else's registry is governed by their terms of use. Introduction You probably got npm because you want to install stuff. The very first thing you will most likely want to run in any node program is npm install to install its dependencies. You can also run npm install blerg to install the latest version of \"blerg\". Check out npm help install for more info. It can do a lot of stuff. Use the npm search command to show everything that's available in the public registry. Use npm ls to show everything you've installed. Dependencies If a package lists a dependency using a git URL, npm will install that dependency using the git ⟨https://github.com/git-guides/install-git⟩ command and will generate an error if it is not installed. If one of the packages npm tries to install is a native node module and requires compiling of C++ Code, npm will use node-gyp ⟨https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp⟩ for that task. For a Unix system, node-gyp ⟨https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp⟩ needs Python, make and a buildchain like GCC. On Windows, Python and Microsoft Visual Studio C++ are needed. For more information visit the node-gyp repository ⟨https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp⟩ and the node-gyp Wiki ⟨https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/wiki⟩. Directories See npm help folders to learn about where npm puts stuff. In particular, npm has two modes of operation: • local mode: npm installs packages into the current project directory, which defaults to the current working directory. Packages install to ./node_modules, and bins to ./node_modules/.bin. • global mode: npm installs packages into the install prefix at $npm_config_prefix/lib/node_modules and bins to $npm_config_prefix/bin. Local mode is the default. Use -g or --global on any command to run in global mode instead. Developer Usage If you're using npm to develop and publish your code, check out the following help topics: • json: Make a package.json file. See package.json ⟨/configuring- npm/package-json⟩. • link: Links your current working code into Node's path, so that you don't have to reinstall every time you make a change. Use npm help link to do this. • install: It's a good idea to install things if you don't need the symbolic link. Especially, installing other peoples code from the registry is done via npm help install • adduser: Create an account or log in. When you do this, npm will store credentials in the user config file. • publish: Use the npm help publish command to upload your code to the registry. Configuration npm is extremely configurable. It reads its configuration options from 5 places. • Command line switches: Set a config with --key val. All keys take a value, even if they are booleans (the config parser doesn't know what the options are at the time of parsing). If you do not provide a value (--key) then the option is set to boolean true. • Environment Variables: Set any config by prefixing the name in an environment variable with npm_config_. For example, export npm_config_key=val. • User Configs: The file at $HOME/.npmrc is an ini-formatted list of configs. If present, it is parsed. If the userconfig option is set in the cli or env, that file will be used instead. • Global Configs: The file found at ./etc/npmrc (relative to the global prefix will be parsed if it is found. See npm help prefix for more info on the global prefix. If the globalconfig option is set in the cli, env, or user config, then that file is parsed instead. • Defaults: npm's default configuration options are defined in lib/utils/config/definitions.js. These must not be changed. See npm help config for much much more information. Contributions Patches welcome!

interpret the next argument as a directory and change the working directory to it before doing anything else -e --remove-empty-files causes patch to remove output files that are empty after the patches have been applied this option is useful when applying patches that create or remove files -e --ed forces patch to interpret the patch file as an ed 1 script -f sets the maximum fuzz factor this option only applies to context diffs and causes patch to ignore up to that many lines in looking for places to install a hunk note that a larger fuzz factor increases the odds of a faulty patch the default fuzz factor is 2 and it may not be set to more than the number of lines of context in the context diff ordinarily 3 -f --force forces patch to assume that the user knows exactly what he or she is doing and to not ask any questions it assumes the following skip patches for which a file to patch cannot be found patch files even though they have the wrong version for the prereq line in the patch and assume that patches are not reversed even if they look like they are this option does not suppress commentary use -s for that --help print a help message and exit -i causes the next argument to be interpreted as the input file name i e a patchfile this option may be specified multiple times -l --ignore-whitespace causes the pattern matching to be done loosely in case the tabs and spaces have been munged in your input file any sequence of whitespace in the pattern line will match any sequence in the input file normal characters must still match exactly each line of the context must still match a line in the input file -n --forward causes patch to ignore patches that it thinks are reversed or already applied see also -r -n --normal forces patch to interpret the patch file as a normal diff -o causes the next argument to be interpreted as the output file name -p sets the pathname strip count which controls how pathnames found in the patch file are treated in case you keep your files in a different directory than the person who sent out the patch the strip count specifies how many slashes are to be stripped from the front of the pathname any intervening directory names also go away for example supposing the file name in the patch file was u howard src blurfl blurfl c setting -p0 gives the entire pathname unmodified third you can create a file by sending out a diff that compares a null file to the file you want to create if the file you want to create already exists in the target directory when the diff is applied then patch will identify the patch as potentially reversed and offer to reverse the patch fourth take care not to send out reversed patches since it makes people wonder whether they already applied the patch fifth while you may be able to get away with putting 582 diff listings into one file it is probably wiser to group related patches into separate files in case something goes haywire -p1 gives u howard src blurfl blurfl c without the leading slash --quoting-style controls how patch writes out filenames to the console the valid values for style are literal write filenames without any special quoting shell quote filenames if they contain shell metacharacters or other characters that may be problematic e g spaces shell-always always quote filenames as if they contain shell metacharacters or other problematic characters c quote filenames as if they are a c style string escape does the same as c except quotes will be omitted the default quoting option is shell unless quoting style is set -r --reverse tells patch that this patch was created with the old and new files swapped yes i am afraid that does happen occasionally human nature being what it is patch will attempt to swap each hunk around before applying it rejects will come out in the swapped format the -r option will not work with ed diff scripts because there is too little information to reconstruct the reverse operation if the first hunk of a patch fails patch will reverse the hunk to see if it can be applied that way if it can you will be asked if you want to have the -r option set if it cannot the patch will continue to be applied normally note this method cannot detect a reversed patch if it is a normal diff and if the first command is an append i e it should have been a delete since appends always succeed due to the fact that a null context will match anywhere luckily most patches add or change lines rather than delete them so most reversed normal diffs will begin with a delete which will fail triggering the heuristic -r causes the next argument to be interpreted as the reject file name -s --quiet --silent makes patch do its work silently unless an error occurs -t tells patch to set the access and modification times of the output file based on timestamps included in the diff s header the -t option will force patch to assume the timestamps provided are in the system s local timezone unless a timezone offset is present in the timstamp patch will not change the times on the output file unless the original file s timestamp matches the proper file s timestamp in the diff header and the patch context matched the original file with neither fuzz nor offsets both of these caveats are ignored if the -f flag has been specified -t --batch similar to -f in that it suppresses questions but makes some different assumptions skip patches for which a file to patch cannot be found the same as -f skip patches for which the file has the wrong version for the prereq line in the patch and assume that patches are reversed if they look like they are -u --unified forces patch to interpret the patch file as a unified context diff a unidiff -v causes the next argument to be interpreted as a method for creating backup file names the type of backups made can also be given in the patch version control or version control environment variables which are overridden by this option the -b option overrides this option causing the prefix to always be used for making backup file names the values of the patch version control and version control environment variables and the argument to the -v option are like the gnu emacs version-control variable they also recognize synonyms that are more descriptive the valid values are unique abbreviations are accepted t numbered always make numbered backups nil existing make numbered backups of files that already have them simple backups of the others never simple always make simple backups none do not make backups -v --version causes patch to print out its revision header and patch level -x sets internal debugging flags and is of interest only to patch patchers -y prepend prefix to the basename of the file to be backed up for example specifying -y 0 when patching a file u howard src blurfl blurfl c will create the backup at u howard src blurfl 0 blurfl c orig -z tells patch to set the access and modification times of the output file based on timestamps included in the diff s header the -z option will force patch to assume the timestamps provided are in utc unless the timezone offset is present in the timstamp note that the caveats described with the -t option about when the output file s modification time is changed also apply to the -z option --posix enables strict ieee std 1003 1-2008 posix 1 conformance specifically 1 backup files are not created unless the -b option is specified 2 if unspecified the file name used is the first of the old new and index files that exists patch application patch will try to skip any leading garbage apply the diff and then skip any trailing garbage thus you could feed an article or message containing a diff listing to patch and it should work if the entire diff is indented by a consistent amount this will be taken into account with context diffs and to a lesser extent with normal diffs patch can detect when the line numbers mentioned in the patch are incorrect and will attempt to find the correct place to apply each hunk of the patch as a first guess it takes the line number mentioned for the hunk plus or minus any offset used in applying the previous hunk if that is not the correct place patch will scan both forwards and backwards for a set of lines matching the context given in the hunk first patch looks for a place where all lines of the context match if no such place is found and it is a context diff and the maximum fuzz factor is set to 1 or more then another scan takes place ignoring the first and last line of context if that fails and the maximum fuzz factor is set to 2 or more the first two and last two lines of context are ignored and another scan is made the default maximum fuzz factor is 2 if patch cannot find a place to install that hunk of the patch it will put the hunk out to a reject file which normally is the name of the output file plus rej note that the rejected hunk will come out in context diff form whether the input patch was a context diff or a normal diff if the input was a normal diff many of the contexts will simply be null the line numbers on the hunks in the reject file may be different than in the patch file they reflect the approximate location patch thinks the failed hunks belong in the new file rather than the old one as each hunk is completed you will be told whether the hunk succeeded or failed and which line in the new file patch thought the hunk should go on if this is different from the line number specified in the diff you will be told the offset a single large offset may be an indication that a hunk was installed in the wrong place you will also be told if a fuzz factor was used to make the match in which case you should also be slightly suspicious filename determination if no original file is specified on the command line patch will try to figure out from the leading garbage what the name of the file to edit is when checking a prospective file name pathname components are stripped as specified by the -p option and the file s existence and writability are checked relative to the current working directory or the directory specified by the -d option if the diff is a context or unified diff patch is able to determine the old and new file names from the diff header for context diffs the old file is specified in the line beginning with and the new file is specified in the line beginning with --- for a unified diff the old file is specified in the line beginning with --- and the new file is specified in the line beginning with if there is an index line in the leading garbage regardless of the diff type patch will use the file name from that line as the index file patch will choose the file name by performing the following steps with the first match used 1 if patch is operating in strict ieee std 1003 1-2008 posix 1 mode the first of the old new and index file names that exist is used 2 if patch is not operating in strict ieee std 1003 1-2008 posix 1 mode and a non-zero --get argument has been supplied then patch will choose one of the index old or new filenames that are detected to exist under a version control system otherwise patch will examine either the old and new file names or for a non- context diff the index file name and choose the file name with the fewest path components the shortest basename and the shortest total file name length in that order 3 if no suitable file was found to patch the patch file is a context or unified diff and the old file was zero length the new file name is created and used 4 if the file name still cannot be determined patch will prompt the user for the file name to use additionally if the leading garbage contains a prereq line patch will take the first word from the prerequisites line normally a version number and check the input file to see if that word can be found if not patch will ask for confirmation before proceeding the upshot of all this is that you should be able to say while in a news interface the following patch -d usr src local blurfl and patch a file in the blurfl directory directly from the article containing the patch backup files by default the patched version is put in place of the original with the original file backed up to the same name with the extension orig or as specified by the -b -v or -z options the extension used for making backup files may also be specified in the simple backup suffix environment variable which is overridden by the options above if the backup file is a symbolic or hard link to the original file patch creates a new backup file name by changing the first lowercase letter in the last component of the file s name into uppercase if there are no more lowercase letters in the name it removes the first character from the name it repeats this process until it comes up with a backup file that does not already exist or is not linked to the original file you may also specify where you want the output to go with the -o option if that file already exists it is backed up first notes for patch senders there are several things you should bear in mind if you are going to be sending out patches first you can save people a lot of grief by keeping a patchlevel h file which is patched to increment the patch level as the first diff in the patch file you send out if you put a prereq line in with the patch it will not let them apply patches out of order without some warning second make sure you have specified the file names right either in a context diff header or with an index line if you are patching something in a subdirectory be sure to tell the patch user to specify a -p sets the pathname strip count which controls how pathnames found in the patch file are treated in case you keep your files in a different directory than the person who sent out the patch the strip count specifies how many slashes are to be stripped from the front of the pathname any intervening directory names also go away for example supposing the file name in the patch file was u howard src blurfl blurfl c setting -p0 gives the entire pathname unmodified third you can create a file by sending out a diff that compares a null file

If unspecified, the file name used is the first of the old, new and index files that exists. Patch Application patch will try to skip any leading garbage, apply the diff, and then skip any trailing garbage.  Thus you could feed an article or message containing a diff listing to patch, and it should work.  If the entire diff is indented by a consistent amount, this will be taken into account. With context diffs, and to a lesser extent with normal diffs, patch can detect when the line numbers mentioned in the patch are incorrect, and will attempt to find the correct place to apply each hunk of the patch. As a first guess, it takes the line number mentioned for the hunk, plus or minus any offset used in applying the previous hunk.  If that is not the correct place, patch will scan both forwards and backwards for a set of lines matching the context given in the hunk.  First patch looks for a place where all lines of the context match.  If no such place is found, and it is a context diff, and the maximum fuzz factor is set to 1 or more, then another scan takes place ignoring the first and last line of context.  If that fails, and the maximum fuzz factor is set to 2 or more, the first two and last two lines of context are ignored, and another scan is made.  (The default maximum fuzz factor is 2). If patch cannot find a place to install that hunk of the patch, it will put the hunk out to a reject file, which normally is the name of the output file plus \".rej\".  (Note that the rejected hunk will come out in context diff form whether the input patch was a context diff or a normal diff.  If the input was a normal diff, many of the contexts will simply be null.)\tThe line numbers on the hunks in the reject file may be different than in the patch file: they reflect the approximate location patch thinks the failed hunks belong in the new file rather than the old one. As each hunk is completed, you will be told whether the hunk succeeded or failed, and which line (in the new file) patch thought the hunk should go on.  If this is different from the line number specified in the diff, you will be told the offset.  A single large offset MAY be an indication that a hunk was installed in the wrong place.  You will also be told if a fuzz factor was used to make the match, in which case you should also be slightly suspicious. Filename Determination If no original file is specified on the command line, patch will try to figure out from the leading garbage what the name of the file to edit is. When checking a prospective file name, pathname components are stripped as specified by the -p option and the file's existence and writability are checked relative to the current working directory (or the directory specified by the -d option). If the diff is a context or unified diff, patch is able to determine the old and new file names from the diff header.  For context diffs, the “old” file is specified in the line beginning with \"***\" and the “new” file is specified in the line beginning with \"---\".  For a unified diff, the “old” file is specified in the line beginning with \"---\" and the “new” file is specified in the line beginning with \"+++\".\tIf there is an \"Index\": line in the leading garbage (regardless of the diff type), patch will use the file name from that line as the “index” file. patch will choose the file name by performing the following steps, with the first match used: 1.   If patch is operating in strict IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”) mode, the first of the “old”, “new” and “index” file names that exist is used. 2.   If patch is not operating in strict IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”) mode, and a non-zero --get argument has been supplied, then patch will choose one of the “index”, “old” or “new” filenames that are detected to exist under a version control system.  Otherwise, patch will examine either the “old” and “new” file names or, for a non- context diff, the “index” file name, and choose the file name with the fewest path components, the shortest basename, and the shortest total file name length (in that order). 3.   If no suitable file was found to patch, the patch file is a context or unified diff, and the old file was zero length, the new file name is created and used. 4.   If the file name still cannot be determined, patch will prompt the user for the file name to use. Additionally, if the leading garbage contains a \"Prereq: \" line, patch will take the first word from the prerequisites line (normally a version number) and check the input file to see if that word can be found.  If not, patch will ask for confirmation before proceeding. The upshot of all this is that you should be able to say, while in a news interface, the following: | patch -d /usr/src/local/blurfl and patch a file in the blurfl directory directly from the article containing the patch. Backup Files By default, the patched version is put in place of the original, with the original file backed up to the same name with the extension \".orig\", or as specified by the -B, -V, or -z options.  The extension used for making backup files may also be specified in the SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX environment variable, which is overridden by the options above. If the backup file is a symbolic or hard link to the original file, patch creates a new backup file name by changing the first lowercase letter in the last component of the file's name into uppercase.  If there are no more lowercase letters in the name, it removes the first character from the name.\tIt repeats this process until it comes up with a backup file that does not already exist or is not linked to the original file. You may also specify where you want the output to go with the -o option; if that file already exists, it is backed up first. Notes For Patch Senders There are several things you should bear in mind if you are going to be sending out patches: First, you can save people a lot of grief by keeping a patchlevel.h file which is patched to increment the patch level as the first diff in the patch file you send out.  If you put a \"Prereq\": line in with the patch, it will not let them apply patches out of order without some warning. Second, make sure you have specified the file names right, either in a context diff header, or with an \"Index\": line.  If you are patching something in a subdirectory, be sure to tell the patch user to specify a"

For example, “-p ff” will cause the sent packet to be filled with all ones. TTL DETAILS The TTL value of an IP packet represents the maximum number of IP routers that the packet can go through before being thrown away.  In current practice you can expect each router in the Internet to decrement the TTL field by exactly one. The TCP/IP specification recommends setting the TTL field for IP packets to 64, but many systems use smaller values (4.3BSD uses 30, 4.2BSD used 15). The maximum possible value of this field is 255, and most UNIX systems set the TTL field of ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to 255.  This is why you will find you can “ping” some hosts, but not reach them with telnet(1) or ftp(1). In normal operation ping prints the ttl value from the packet it receives.\tWhen a remote system receives a ping packet, it can do one of three things with the TTL field in its response: •\t Not change it; this is what BSD systems did before the 4.3BSD-Tahoe release.  In this case the TTL value in the received packet will be 255 minus the number of routers in the round-trip path. •\t Set it to 255; this is what current BSD systems do.  In this case the TTL value in the received packet will be 255 minus the number of routers in the path from the remote system to the pinging host. •\t Set it to some other value.  Some machines use the same value for ICMP packets that they use for TCP packets, for example either 30 or 60.  Others may use completely wild values. EXIT STATUS The ping utility exits with one of the following values: 0\t     At least one response was heard from the specified host. 2\t     The transmission was successful but no responses were received. any other value An error occurred.

When using ping for fault isolation, it should first be run on the local host, to verify that the local network interface is up and running. Then, hosts and gateways further and further away should be “pinged”. Round-trip times and packet loss statistics are computed.\tIf duplicate packets are received, they are not included in the packet loss calculation, although the round trip time of these packets is used in calculating the round-trip time statistics.  When the specified number of packets have been sent (and received) or if the program is terminated with a SIGINT, a brief summary is displayed, showing the number of packets sent and received, and the minimum, mean, maximum, and standard deviation of the round-trip times. If ping receives a SIGINFO (see the status argument for stty(1)) signal, the current number of packets sent and received, and the minimum, mean, and maximum of the round-trip times will be written to the standard error output. This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement and management.  Because of the load it can impose on the network, it is unwise to use ping during normal operations or from automated scripts. ICMP PACKET DETAILS An IP header without options is 20 bytes.\tAn ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packet contains an additional 8 bytes worth of ICMP header followed by an arbitrary amount of data.\tWhen a packetsize is given, this indicated the size of this extra piece of data (the default is 56).  Thus the amount of data received inside of an IP packet of type ICMP ECHO_REPLY will always be 8 bytes more than the requested data space (the ICMP header). If the data space is at least eight bytes large, ping uses the first eight bytes of this space to include a timestamp which it uses in the computation of round trip times.  If less than eight bytes of pad are specified, no round trip times are given. DUPLICATE AND DAMAGED PACKETS The ping utility will report duplicate and damaged packets.  Duplicate packets should never occur when pinging a unicast address, and seem to be caused by inappropriate link-level retransmissions.  Duplicates may occur in many situations and are rarely (if ever) a good sign, although the presence of low levels of duplicates may not always be cause for alarm. Duplicates are expected when pinging a broadcast or multicast address, since they are not really duplicates but replies from different hosts to the same request. Damaged packets are obviously serious cause for alarm and often indicate broken hardware somewhere in the ping packet's path (in the network or in the hosts). TRYING DIFFERENT DATA PATTERNS The (inter)network layer should never treat packets differently depending on the data contained in the data portion.  Unfortunately, data-dependent problems have been known to sneak into networks and remain undetected for long periods of time.  In many cases the particular pattern that will have problems is something that does not have sufficient “transitions”, such as all ones or all zeros, or a pattern right at the edge, such as almost all zeros.\tIt is not necessarily enough to specify a data pattern of all zeros (for example) on the command line because the pattern that is of interest is at the data link level, and the relationship between what you type and what the controllers transmit can be complicated. This means that if you have a data-dependent problem you will probably have to do a lot of testing to find it.  If you are lucky, you may manage to find a file that either cannot be sent across your network or that takes much longer to transfer than other similar length files.  You can then examine this file for repeated patterns that you can test using the"

        "description": " You may specify up to 16 “pad” bytes to fill out the packet you send.  This is useful for diagnosing data-dependent problems in a network.  For example, “-p ff” will cause the sent packet to be filled with all ones. TTL DETAILS The TTL value of an IP packet represents the maximum number of IP routers that the packet can go through before being thrown away.  In current practice you can expect each router in the Internet to decrement the TTL field by exactly one. The TCP/IP specification recommends setting the TTL field for IP packets to 64, but many systems use smaller values (4.3BSD uses 30, 4.2BSD used 15). The maximum possible value of this field is 255, and most UNIX systems set the TTL field of ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to 255.  This is why you will find you can “ping” some hosts, but not reach them with telnet(1) or ftp(1). In normal operation ping prints the ttl value from the packet it receives.\tWhen a remote system receives a ping packet, it can do one of three things with the TTL field in its response: •\t Not change it; this is what BSD systems did before the 4.3BSD-Tahoe release.  In this case the TTL value in the received packet will be 255 minus the number of routers in the round-trip path. •\t Set it to 255; this is what current BSD systems do.  In this case the TTL value in the received packet will be 255 minus the number of routers in the path from the remote system to the pinging host. •\t Set it to some other value.  Some machines use the same value for ICMP packets that they use for TCP packets, for example either 30 or 60.  Others may use completely wild values. EXIT STATUS The ping utility exits with one of the following values: 0\t     At least one response was heard from the specified host. 2\t     The transmission was successful but no responses were received. any other value An error occurred.  These values are defined in <sysexits.h>. SEE ALSO netstat(1), ifconfig(8), traceroute(8), ping6(8)"

Formats Format strings are similar to printf(3) formats in that they start with %, are then followed by a sequence of formatting characters, and end in a character that selects the field of the struct stat which is to be formatted.  If the % is immediately followed by one of n, t, %, or @, then a newline character, a tab character, a percent character, or the current file number is printed, otherwise the string is examined for the following: Any of the following optional flags: #\t     Selects an alternate output form for octal and hexadecimal output.  Non-zero octal output will have a leading zero, and non- zero hexadecimal output will have “0x” prepended to it. +\t     Asserts that a sign indicating whether a number is positive or negative should always be printed.  Non-negative numbers are not usually printed with a sign. -\t     Aligns string output to the left of the field, instead of to the right. 0\t     Sets the fill character for left padding to the ‘0’ character, instead of a space. space   Reserves a space at the front of non-negative signed output fields.  A ‘+’ overrides a space if both are used. Then the following fields: size    An optional decimal digit string specifying the minimum field width. prec    An optional precision composed of a decimal point ‘.’ and a decimal digit string that indicates the maximum string length, the number of digits to appear after the decimal point in floating point output, or the minimum number of digits to appear in numeric output. fmt     An optional output format specifier which is one of D, O, U, X, F, or S.  These represent signed decimal output, octal output, unsigned decimal output, hexadecimal output, floating point output, and string output, respectively.  Some output formats do not apply to all fields.  Floating point output only applies to timespec fields (the a, m, and c fields). The special output specifier S may be used to indicate that the output, if applicable, should be in string format.  May be used in combination with: amc     Display date in strftime(3) format. dr      Display actual device name. f\t     Display the flags of file as in ls -lTdo. gu      Display group or user name. p\t     Display the mode of file as in ls -lTd. N\t     Displays the name of file. T\t     Displays the type of file. Y\t     Insert a “ -> ” into the output.  Note that the default output format for Y is a string, but if specified explicitly, these four characters are prepended. sub     An optional sub field specifier (high, middle, low).  Only applies to the p, d, r, and T output formats.  It can be one of the following: H\t     “High” — specifies the major number for devices from r or d, the “user” bits for permissions from the string form of p, the file “type” bits from the numeric forms of p, and the long output form of T. L\t     “Low” — specifies the minor number for devices from r or d, the “other” bits for permissions from the string form of p, the “user”, “group”, and “other” bits from the numeric forms of p, and the ls -F style output character for file type when used with T (the use of L for this is optional). M\t     “Middle” — specifies the “group” bits for permissions from the string output form of p, or the “suid”, “sgid”, and “sticky” bits for the numeric forms of p. datum   A required field specifier, being one of the following: d\t     Device upon which file resides (st_dev). i\t     file's inode number (st_ino). p\t     File type and permissions (st_mode). l\t     Number of hard links to file (st_nlink). u, g    User ID and group ID of file's owner (st_uid, st_gid). r\t     Device number for character and block device special files (st_rdev). a, m, c, B The time file was last accessed or modified, or when the inode was last changed, or the birth time of the inode (st_atime, st_mtime, st_ctime, st_birthtime). z\t     The size of file in bytes (st_size). b\t     Number of blocks allocated for file (st_blocks). k\t     Optimal file system I/O operation block size (st_blksize). f\t     User defined flags for file. v\t     Inode generation number (st_gen). The following five field specifiers are not drawn directly from the data in struct stat, but are: N\t     The name of the file. R\t     The absolute pathname corresponding to the file. T\t     The file type, either as in ls -F or in a more descriptive form if the sub field specifier H is given. Y\t     The target of a symbolic link. Z\t     Expands to “major,minor” from the rdev field for character or block special devices and gives size output for all others. Only the % and the field specifier are required.  Most field specifiers default to U as an output form, with the exception of p which defaults to O; a, m, and c which default to D; and Y, T, and N which default to S.

symlink and place the directory s contents in that symlinked dir --link-dest use directory as an alternate base directory to compare files against on the destination machine if file in directory is

--backup-dir -o --owner set the user name to match the source with similar matching logic as for -g if --numeric-ids is also given or if the remote user name is unknown on the local machine set the numeric user id to match the source instead only works if run as root -p shorthand for --partial --progress --partial do not remove partially transferred files if openrsync is interrupted which opens up the possibility for them to be easily resumed later --partial-dir store all partially transferred files in dir to allow an interrupted transfer to resume without re-transferring files implies -partial --password-file define a file to read the password from when connecting to an rsync daemon the password should be written on the first line of the file and may have a terminating newline the pwfile is expected to not be readable by other and to be owned by root if openrsync is running as root --port specify an alternative tcp port number the service can be given as a decimal integer or as a name to be looked up in the services 5 database the default is rsync -m --prune-empty-dirs prune empty directories from the file list on the receiver side empty directories may be excluded from pruning with an exclude or protect filter rule a directory wich only contains other empty non-excluded directories is also considered empty --progress periodically report file transfer progress --protocol force openrsync to operate using the specified protocol version normally the protocol version is negotiated automatically but an older protocol version can be forced with this flag --read-batch read a batch file previously prepared by openrsync from file see the --write-batch option for a description of a batch file when reading a batch file the source arguments are optional and ignored if specified --remove-source-files remove source files as they are transferred into directory files are only removed once they are confirmed to be fully in place by default openrsync will delete files as the transfer progresses but given its asynchronous nature there may be a noticeable delay between a given file finishing its transfer and its subsequent removal when combined with --delay-updates files will be removed in a larger batch toward the end of the transfer --no-implied-dirs changes the default behavior of --relative such that implied directories do not have their attributes modified or are created with default attributes rather than the source attributes if they do not exist this allows the implied directories to differ including being a symlink on one side and a real directory on the other --rsync-path run program on the remote host instead of the default rsync --size-only skip files whose sizes match regardless of timestamp --safe-links skip any symlinks that are unsafe absolute symlinks or where the target is outside the copied tree --sockopts set custom sockopts on the socket created to communicate with an rsync daemon sockopts should be of the form name value where name matches an so option described in setsockopt 2 note that only the following options are currently supported so keepalive so reuseaddr so sndbuf so rcvbuf so sndlowat so rcvlowat so sndtimeo so rcvtimeo so reuseport may not be available on all systems --specials also transfer fifo and unix domain socket files --stats print verbose statistics about the transfer at the end of the run provides details about how much data transfer was saved by openrsync --suffix sets the suffix to be appended to filenames when creating backups on the receiver before replacing files defaults to except when combined with --backup-dir where the default is an empty string --super always attempt traditionally super-user activities this flag mostly interacts with the --owner --group and --devices options which may be permitted to unprivileged users on the receiving end in some configurations --no-super is also supported to avoid them entirely --timeout set the i o timeout in seconds exit if no data was transferred for the specified time the default is 0 which means no timeout -t --times set destination file and directory modification time to match the source when it is updated or created -u --update skip existing files on the destination that have a modification time newer than the source file -v --verbose increase verbosity specify once for files being transferred twice for specific status thrice for per-file transfer information and four times for per-file breakdowns -x --one-file-system do not cross filesystem boundaries if this option is repeated all mount point directories from the copy are omitted otherwise it includes an empty directory at each mount point it encounters -v --version print version and exit --only-write-batch prepare a batch file and write it to file with this option the batch file is written without updating the destination see the below --write-batch option for a description of a batch file --write-batch prepare a batch file and write it to file a batch file is composed of a small heading describing the transfer parameters negotiated followed by a raw dump of the data transmitted by the sender when used with --read-batch on the other side the transfer is simply replayed from the batch file against the application s reeceiver and the destination tree is updated accordingly batch files are intended to reproduce an update to a destination tree to many other identical trees without needing to establish a direct connection between them this mechanism also avoids having to perform many of the intermediate steps required for a transfer such as receiver-side checksums and blocking a remote source or directory has the syntax host path for connecting via ssh 1 or rsync host path or host path for connecting to a remote daemon subsequent to the first remote source the host may be dropped to become just path or path for connecting to a remote daemon with rsync host or host path the first path component is interpreted as a module host module path this only applies to the first source invocation subsequent to that the module should not be specified by default new destination files and directories are given the current time and the source file permissions updated files retain their existing permissions it is an error if updated files have their file types change e g updating a directory with a file at this time source may only consist of regular files directories only with -r or symbolic links only with -l the destination directory must be a directory and is created if not found openrsync also supports a --daemon mode which may be run either standalone or may be invoked by e g inetd 8 or similar services that hand a socket off to an external program for handling daemon options that are shared with the non-daemon mode of openrsync behave as described above options specific to daemon mode are as follows --config load daemon configuration from the named configfile instead of the default location by default openrsync will look for its configuration at etc rsyncd conf see rsyncd conf 5 for details of the format of this file --no-detach run the openrsync daemon in the foreground instead of the background note that the openrsync daemon mode will log to syslog 3 by default unless --log-file is specified regardless of whether --no-detach has been specified to run in the foreground or not patterns and rules the -f --include --include-from --exclude and --exclude-from options may be used to load a filter rule or a set of filter rules a single filter rule consists of a type an optional set of modifiers and a pattern each type has a short name and a long name these will be described in more depth shortly a filter file is a set of rules one per line comments are accepted starting with a empty lines are ignored each rule is of the following form type modifiers pattern if the short name is used then the comma separating the modifiers from the rule type is optional the delimiter between the type modifiers and the pattern may also be an underbar instead of a space the following rule types are supported long name short name description exclude - exclude a file from the transfer include include a file from the transfer merge merge rules in from a file dir-merge merge rules in from a per-directory file hide h hide a file from the transfer show s not hide a file from the transfer protect p protect a file from deletion risk r not protect a file from deletion clear clear the current filter list the following rule modifiers are supported for the exclude and include rule types modifier description match against the absolute pathname of the entry take effect if the pattern does not match the entry c insert the global cvs exclusions s marks a rule as sender-side only r marks a rule as receiver-side only p marks a rule as perishable do not prevent removal of a directory the above modifiers will be ignored if applied to other rule types with the exception of merge and dir-merge rules see the merge rules section for more details of the semantics include and exclude rules the six basic types of include and exclude rules briefly described above are exclude include hide show protect risk the hide and show types are sender-side versions of the exclude and include rules while the protect and risk types are their receiver- side equivalents each of these rules take a pattern that is typically matched against the basename of a transfer candidate s name a trailing in the pattern indicates that the entry should only match a directory name while a leading indicates that the pattern is anchored to the beginning of the transfer path the beginning of the transfer path is either the root of the transfer or the directory containing a dir-merge file if the rule in question comes from a dir-merge file a at any other position or a in the pattern will match against the full path to the transfer entry beginning at the root of the transfer patterns may contain any of the following wildcards wildcard description matches any character except matches zero or more characters except matches zero or more characters character class as in posix regular expressions matches a directory and all of its contents backslashes may be used to escape one of the above wildcard characters but is ordinary when appearing before any other character note that exclude rules with the c modifier applied do not take a pattern merge rules the merge rules merge and dir-merge are another way to insert a filter rule file merge rules are evaluated once as soon as they are processed and the rules read in are inserted at the same position as the merge file dir-merge rules are evaluated as openrsync progresses through the file list searching each directory encountered for the file named in the rule s pattern if a dir-merge rule appears before a clear rule it will not be processed at all dir-merge rules are inserted into their own chain of rules rather than directly into the global ruleset clear rules appearing in a dir- merged file do not affect the global ruleset as we find dir-merged files in the transfer their rules are prepended to their dir-merge chain so that a deeper directory s rules take precedence over its parent s rules when one of the above exclude include modifiers are applied to merge or dir-merge rule those modifiers are applied to the exclude include rules within the file the following modifiers may additionally be specified for merge rules modifier description - all rules within are exclude rules all rules within are include rules c file processing should assume cvs-compatible parsing e exclude the file s name from the transfer n rules are not inherited by subdirectories w rules are word-split instead of line-split the cvs-compatible modifier implies the - n and w modifiers if a filename is not supplied with it then cvsignore is used name macos 15 5 june 17 2025 macos 15 5",

A batch file is composed of a small heading describing the transfer parameters negotiated, followed by a raw dump of the data transmitted by the sender.  When used with --read-batch on the other side, the transfer is simply replayed from the batch file against the application's reeceiver, and the destination tree is updated accordingly. Batch files are intended to reproduce an update to a destination tree to many other identical trees without needing to establish a direct connection between them.  This mechanism also avoids having to perform many of the intermediate steps required for a transfer, such as receiver-side checksums and blocking. A remote source or directory has the syntax host:path for connecting via ssh(1), or rsync://host/path or host::path for connecting to a remote daemon.  Subsequent to the first remote source, the host may be dropped to become just :path or ::path. For connecting to a remote daemon with rsync://host or host::path, the first path component is interpreted as a \"module\": host::module/path. This only applies to the first source invocation; subsequent to that, the module should not be specified. By default, new destination files and directories are given the current time and the source file permissions.  Updated files retain their existing permissions.  It is an error if updated files have their file types change (e.g., updating a directory with a file). At this time, source may only consist of regular files, directories (only with -r), or symbolic links (only with -l).  The destination directory must be a directory and is created if not found. openrsync also supports a --daemon mode, which may be run either standalone or may be invoked by, e.g., inetd(8) or similar services that hand a socket off to an external program for handling. Daemon options that are shared with the non-daemon mode of openrsync behave as described above.  Options specific to daemon mode are as follows:"

Note that the openrsync daemon mode will log to syslog(3) by default unless --log-file is specified, regardless of whether --no-detach has been specified to run in the foreground or not. PATTERNS AND RULES The -f, --include, --include-from, --exclude, and --exclude-from options may be used to load a filter rule or a set of filter rules.  A single filter rule consists of a type, an optional set of modifiers, and a pattern.  Each type has a short name and a long name.  These will be described in more depth shortly. A filter file is a set of rules, one per line.  Comments are accepted, starting with a ‘#’.  Empty lines are ignored. Each rule is of the following form: <TYPE>[,<MODIFIERS>] <PATTERN> If the short name is used, then the comma separating the modifiers from the rule type is optional.  The delimiter between the type/modifiers and the pattern may also be an underbar instead of a space. The following rule types are supported: LONG NAME\tSHORT NAME    DESCRIPTION exclude\t-\t      Exclude a file from the transfer include\t+\t      Include a file from the transfer merge\t.\t      Merge rules in from a file dir-merge\t:\t      Merge rules in from a per-directory file hide \tH\t      Hide a file from the transfer show \tS\t      “not hide a file from the transfer” protect\tP\t      Protect a file from deletion risk \tR\t      “not protect a file from deletion” clear\t!\t      Clear the current filter list The following rule modifiers are supported for the “exclude” and “include” rule types: MODIFIER    DESCRIPTION /\t       Match against the absolute pathname of the entry !\t       Take effect if the pattern does not match the entry C\t       Insert the global CVS exclusions s\t       Marks a rule as sender-side only r\t       Marks a rule as receiver-side only p\t       Marks a rule as perishable (do not prevent removal of a directory) The above modifiers will be ignored if applied to other rule types, with the exception of “merge” and “dir-merge” rules.  See the Merge Rules section for more details of the semantics. Include and Exclude Rules The six basic types of include and exclude rules briefly described above are “exclude”, “include”, “hide”, “show”, “protect”, “risk”. The “hide” and “show” types are sender-side versions of the “exclude” and “include” rules, while the “protect” and “risk” types are their receiver- side equivalents. Each of these rules take a pattern that is typically matched against the basename of a transfer candidate's name.  A trailing ‘/’ in the pattern indicates that the entry should only match a directory name, while a leading ‘/’ indicates that the pattern is anchored to the beginning of the transfer path.  The beginning of the transfer path is either the root of the transfer, or the directory containing a dir-merge file if the rule in question comes from a dir-merge file.  A ‘/’ at any other position, or a “**” in the pattern, will match against the full path to the transfer entry beginning at the root of the transfer. Patterns may contain any of the following wildcards. WILDCARD    DESCRIPTION ?\t       Matches any character, except ‘/’ *\t       Matches zero or more characters, except ‘/’ **\t       Matches zero or more characters [\t       Character class, as in POSIX regular expressions /***        Matches a directory and all of its contents Backslashes may be used to escape one of the above wildcard characters, but is ordinary when appearing before any other character. Note that exclude rules with the “C” modifier applied do not take a pattern. Merge Rules The merge rules, “merge” and “dir-merge”, are another way to insert a filter rule file.\t“merge” rules are evaluated once as soon as they are processed, and the rules read in are inserted at the same position as the merge file.  “dir-merge” rules are evaluated as openrsync progresses through the file list, searching each directory encountered for the file named in the rule's pattern. If a “dir-merge” rule appears before a “clear” rule, it will not be processed at all. “dir-merge” rules are inserted into their own chain of rules, rather than directly into the global ruleset.\t“clear” rules appearing in a dir- merged file do not affect the global ruleset.  As we find dir-merged files in the transfer, their rules are prepended to their dir-merge chain so that a deeper directory's rules take precedence over its parent's rules. When one of the above exclude/include modifiers are applied to “merge” or “dir-merge” rule, those modifiers are applied to the exclude/include rules within the file.  The following modifiers may additionally be specified for merge rules: MODIFIER    DESCRIPTION -\t       All rules within are exclude rules +\t       All rules within are include rules C\t       File processing should assume CVS-compatible parsing e\t       Exclude the file's name from the transfer n\t       Rules are not inherited by subdirectories w\t       Rules are word-split instead of line-split The CVS-compatible modifier implies the ‘-’, ‘n’ and ‘w’ modifiers.  If a filename is not supplied with it, then “.cvsignore” is used."

portions of the command normally sed cyclically copies a line of input not including its terminating newline character into a pattern space unless there is something left after a d function applies all of the commands with addresses that select that pattern space copies the pattern space to the standard output appending a newline and deletes the pattern space some of the functions use a hold space to save all or part of the pattern space for subsequent retrieval sed addresses an address is not required but if specified must have one of the following formats a number that counts input lines cumulatively across input files or in each file independently if a -i option is in effect a dollar character that addresses the last line of input or the last line of the current file if a -i option was specified a context address that consists of a regular expression preceded and followed by a delimiter the closing delimiter can also optionally be followed by the i character to indicate that the regular expression is to be matched in a case-insensitive way a command line with no addresses selects every pattern space a command line with one address selects all of the pattern spaces that match the address a command line with two addresses selects an inclusive range this range starts with the first pattern space that matches the first address the end of the range is the next following pattern space that matches the second address if the second address is a number less than or equal to the line number first selected only that line is selected the number in the second address may be prefixed with a to specify the number of lines to match after the first pattern in the case when the second address is a context address sed does not re-match the second address against the pattern space that matched the first address starting at the first line following the selected range sed starts looking again for the first address editing commands can be applied to non-selected pattern spaces by use of the exclamation character function sed regular expressions the regular expressions used in sed by default are basic regular expressions bres see re format 7 for more information but extended modern regular expressions can be used instead if the -e flag is given in addition sed has the following two additions to regular expressions 1 in a context address any character other than a backslash or newline character may be used to delimit the regular expression the opening delimiter needs to be preceded by a backslash unless it is a slash for example the context address xabcx is equivalent to abc also putting a backslash character before the delimiting character within the regular expression causes the character to be treated literally for example in the context address xabc xdefx the re delimiter is an x and the second x stands for itself so that the regular expression is abcxdef 2 the escape sequence n matches a newline character embedded in the pattern space you cannot however use a literal newline character in an address or in the substitute command one special feature of sed regular expressions is that they can default to the last regular expression used if a regular expression is empty i e just the delimiter characters are specified the last regular expression encountered is used instead the last regular expression is defined as the last regular expression used as part of an address or substitute command and at run-time not compile-time for example the command abc s xxx will substitute xxx for the pattern abc sed functions in the following list of commands the maximum number of permissible addresses for each command is indicated by 0addr 1addr or 2addr representing zero one or two addresses the argument text consists of one or

        "description": "Make output unbuffered. The form of a sed command is as follows: [address[,address]]function[arguments] Whitespace may be inserted before the first address and the function portions of the command. Normally, sed cyclically copies a line of input, not including its terminating newline character, into a pattern space, (unless there is something left after a “D” function), applies all of the commands with addresses that select that pattern space, copies the pattern space to the standard output, appending a newline, and deletes the pattern space. Some of the functions use a hold space to save all or part of the pattern space for subsequent retrieval. Sed Addresses An address is not required, but if specified must have one of the following formats: •   a number that counts input lines cumulatively across input files (or in each file independently if a -i option is in effect); •   a dollar (“$”) character that addresses the last line of input (or the last line of the current file if a -i option was specified); •   a context address that consists of a regular expression preceded and followed by a delimiter.  The closing delimiter can also optionally be followed by the “I” character, to indicate that the regular expression is to be matched in a case-insensitive way. A command line with no addresses selects every pattern space. A command line with one address selects all of the pattern spaces that match the address. A command line with two addresses selects an inclusive range.  This range starts with the first pattern space that matches the first address.  The end of the range is the next following pattern space that matches the second address.  If the second address is a number less than or equal to the line number first selected, only that line is selected.  The number in the second address may be prefixed with a (“+”) to specify the number of lines to match after the first pattern.  In the case when the second address is a context address, sed does not re-match the second address against the pattern space that matched the first address.\tStarting at the first line following the selected range, sed starts looking again for the first address. Editing commands can be applied to non-selected pattern spaces by use of the exclamation character (“!”) function. Sed Regular Expressions The regular expressions used in sed, by default, are basic regular expressions (BREs, see re_format(7) for more information), but extended (modern) regular expressions can be used instead if the -E flag is given. In addition, sed has the following two additions to regular expressions: 1.   In a context address, any character other than a backslash (“\\”) or newline character may be used to delimit the regular expression. The opening delimiter needs to be preceded by a backslash unless it is a slash.  For example, the context address \\xabcx is equivalent to /abc/.  Also, putting a backslash character before the delimiting character within the regular expression causes the character to be treated literally.  For example, in the context address \\xabc\\xdefx, the RE delimiter is an “x” and the second “x” stands for itself, so that the regular expression is “abcxdef”. 2.   The escape sequence \\n matches a newline character embedded in the pattern space.  You cannot, however, use a literal newline character in an address or in the substitute command. One special feature of sed regular expressions is that they can default to the last regular expression used.  If a regular expression is empty, i.e., just the delimiter characters are specified, the last regular expression encountered is used instead.  The last regular expression is defined as the last regular expression used as part of an address or substitute command, and at run-time, not compile-time.  For example, the command “/abc/s//XXX/” will substitute “XXX” for the pattern “abc”. Sed Functions In the following list of commands, the maximum number of permissible addresses for each command is indicated by [0addr], [1addr], or [2addr], representing zero, one, or two addresses. The argument text consists of one or more lines.  To embed a newline in the text, precede it with a backslash.  Other backslashes in text are deleted and the following character taken literally. The “r” and “w” functions take an optional file parameter, which should be separated from the function letter by white space.  Each file given as an argument to sed is created (or its contents truncated) before any input processing begins. The “b”, “r”, “s”, “t”, “w”, “y”, “!”, and “:” functions all accept additional arguments.  The following synopses indicate which arguments have to be separated from the function letters by white space characters. Two of the functions take a function-list.  This is a list of sed functions separated by newlines, as follows: { function function ... function } The “{” can be preceded by white space and can be followed by white space.  The function can be preceded by white space.  The terminating “}” must be preceded by a newline, and may also be preceded by white space. [2addr] function-list Execute function-list only when the pattern space is selected. [1addr]a\\ text    Write text to standard output immediately before each attempt to read a line of input, whether by executing the “N” function or by beginning a new cycle. [2addr]b[label] Branch to the “:” function with the specified label.  If the label is not specified, branch to the end of the script. [2addr]c\\ text    Delete the pattern space.\tWith 0 or 1 address or at the end of a 2-address range, text is written to the standard output. [2addr]d Delete the pattern space and start the next cycle. [2addr]D Delete the initial segment of the pattern space through the first newline character and start the next cycle. [2addr]g Replace the contents of the pattern space with the contents of the hold space. [2addr]G Append a newline character followed by the contents of the hold space to the pattern space. [2addr]h Replace the contents of the hold space with the contents of the pattern space. [2addr]H Append a newline character followed by the contents of the pattern space to the hold space. [1addr]i\\ text    Write text to the standard output. [2addr]l (The letter ell.)\tWrite the pattern space to the standard output in a visually unambiguous form.  This form is as follows: backslash\t      \\\\ alert\t      \\a form-feed\t      \\f carriage-return    \\r tab\t\t      \\t vertical tab       \\v Nonprintable characters are written as three-digit octal numbers (with a preceding backslash) for each byte in the character (most significant byte first).  Long lines are folded, with the point of folding indicated by displaying a backslash followed by a newline.  The end of each line is marked with a “$”. [2addr]n Write the pattern space to the standard output if the default output has not been suppressed, and replace the pattern space with the next line of input. [2addr]N Append the next line of input to the pattern space, using an embedded newline character to separate the appended material from the original contents.  Note that the current line number changes. [2addr]p Write the pattern space to standard output. [2addr]P Write the pattern space, up to the first newline character to the standard output. [1addr]q Branch to the end of the script and quit without starting a new cycle. [1addr]r file Copy the contents of file to the standard output immediately before the next attempt to read a line of input.  If file cannot be read for any reason, it is silently ignored and no error condition is set. [2addr]s/regular expression/replacement/flags Substitute the replacement string for the first instance of the regular expression in the pattern space.  Any character other than backslash or newline can be used instead of a slash to delimit the RE and the replacement.  Within the RE and the replacement, the RE delimiter itself can be used as a literal character if it is preceded by a backslash. An ampersand (“&”) appearing in the replacement is replaced by the string matching the RE.  The special meaning of “&” in this context can be suppressed by preceding it by a backslash.\tThe string “\\#”, where “#” is a digit, is replaced by the text matched by the corresponding backreference expression (see re_format(7)). A line can be split by substituting a newline character into it. To specify a newline character in the replacement string, precede it with a backslash. The value of flags in the substitute function is zero or more of the following: N\t   Make the substitution only for the N'th occurrence of the regular expression in the pattern space. g\t   Make the substitution for all non-overlapping matches of the regular expression, not just the first one. p\t   Write the pattern space to standard output if a replacement was made.  If the replacement string is identical to that which it replaces, it is still considered to have been a replacement. w file  Append the pattern space to file if a replacement was made.  If the replacement string is identical to that which it replaces, it is still considered to have been a replacement. i or I  Match the regular expression in a case-insensitive way. [2addr]t [label] Branch to the “:” function bearing the label if any substitutions have been made since the most recent reading of an input line or execution of a “t” function.  If no label is specified, branch to the end of the script. [2addr]w file Append the pattern space to the file. [2addr]x Swap the contents of the pattern and hold spaces. [2addr]y/string1/string2/ Replace all occurrences of characters in string1 in the pattern space with the corresponding characters from string2.  Any character other than a backslash or newline can be used instead of a slash to delimit the strings.  Within string1 and string2, a backslash followed by any character other than a newline is that literal character, and a backslash followed by an ``n'' is replaced by a newline character. [2addr]!function [2addr]!function-list Apply the function or function-list only to the lines that are not selected by the address(es). [0addr]:label This function does nothing; it bears a label to which the “b” and “t” commands may branch. [1addr]= Write the line number to the standard output followed by a newline character. [0addr] Empty lines are ignored. [0addr]# The “#” and the remainder of the line are ignored (treated as a comment), with the single exception that if the first two characters in the file are “#n”, the default output is suppressed.  This is the same as specifying the -n option on the command line."

applies globally to all key specifications otherwise -b can be attached independently to each field argument of the key specifications note that sort keys specified with the -k option may have a variable number of leading whitespace characters that will affect the result as described below in the -t option description -k define a restricted sort key that has the starting position field1 and optional ending position field2 of a key field the subsequent keys are compared when earlier keys compare equal the -k option replaces the obsolete options pos1 and -pos2 but the old notation is also supported -k define a restricted sort key that has the starting position field1 and optional ending position field2 of a key field the subsequent keys are compared when earlier keys compare equal the -k option replaces the obsolete options pos1 and -pos2 but the old notation is also supported -t use char as a field separator character the initial char is not considered to be part of a field when determining key offsets each occurrence of char is significant for example charchar delimits an empty field if -t is not specified the default field separator is a sequence of blank space characters and consecutive blank spaces do not delimit an empty field however the initial blank space is considered part of a field when determining key offsets to use nul as field separator use -t 0 --batch-size num specify maximum number of files that can be opened by sort at once this option affects behavior when having many input files or using temporary files the default value is 16 --compress-program program use program to compress temporary files program must compress standard input to standard output when called without arguments when called with argument -d it must decompress standard input to standard output if program fails sort must exit with error an example of program that can be used here is bzip2 --random-source filename in random sort the file content is used as the source of the seed data for the hash function choice two invocations of random sort with the same seed data will use the same hash function and will produce the same result if the input is also identical by default file dev random is used --debug print some extra information about the sorting process to the standard output --parallel set the maximum number of execution threads default number

sort algorithm cannot be used with -u and -s --heapsort try to use heap sort if the sort specifications allow this sort algorithm cannot be used with -u and -s --mmap try to use file memory mapping system call it may increase speed in some cases the following operands are available file the pathname of a file to be sorted merged or checked if no file operands are specified or if a file operand is - the standard input is used a field is defined as a maximal sequence of characters other than the field separator and record separator newline by default initial blank spaces are included in the field unless -b has been specified the first blank space of a sequence of blank spaces acts as the field separator and is included in the field unless -t is specified for example all blank spaces at the beginning of a line are considered to be part of the first field fields are specified by the -k field1 field2 command-line option if field2 is missing the end of the key defaults to the end of the line the arguments field1 and field2 have the form m n m n 0 and can be followed by one or more of the modifiers b d f i n g m and r which correspond to the options discussed above when b is specified it applies only to field1 or field2 where it is specified while the rest of the modifiers apply to the whole key field regardless if they are specified only with field1 or field2 or both a field1 position specified by m n is interpreted as the nth character from the beginning of the mth field a missing n in field1 means 1 indicating the first character of the mth field if the -b option is in effect n is counted from the first non-blank character in the mth field m 1b refers to the first non-blank character in the mth field 1 n refers to the nth character from the beginning of the line if n is greater than the length of the line the field is taken to be empty nth positions are always counted from the field beginning even if the field is shorter than the number of specified positions thus the key can really start from a position in a subsequent field a field2 position specified by m n is interpreted as the nth character including separators from the beginning of the mth field a missing n indicates the last character of the mth field m 0 designates the end of a line thus the option -k v x w y is synonymous with the obsolete option v-1 x-1 -w-1 y when y is omitted -k v x w is synonymous with v-1 x-1 -w 0 the obsolete pos1 -pos2 option is still supported except for -w 0b which has no -k equivalent ls sort sort -v name use space symbols as field separators as modern gnu sort

The following operands are available: file    The pathname of a file to be sorted, merged, or checked.  If no file operands are specified, or if a file operand is -, the standard input is used. A field is defined as a maximal sequence of characters other than the field separator and record separator (newline by default).  Initial blank spaces are included in the field unless -b has been specified; the first blank space of a sequence of blank spaces acts as the field separator and is included in the field (unless -t is specified).  For example, all blank spaces at the beginning of a line are considered to be part of the first field. Fields are specified by the -k field1[,field2] command-line option.  If field2 is missing, the end of the key defaults to the end of the line. The arguments field1 and field2 have the form m.n (m,n > 0) and can be followed by one or more of the modifiers b, d, f, i, n, g, M and r, which correspond to the options discussed above.  When b is specified it applies only to field1 or field2 where it is specified while the rest of the modifiers apply to the whole key field regardless if they are specified only with field1 or field2 or both.  A field1 position specified by m.n is interpreted as the nth character from the beginning of the mth field.\tA missing .n in field1 means ‘.1’, indicating the first character of the mth field; if the -b option is in effect, n is counted from the first non-blank character in the mth field; m.1b refers to the first non-blank character in the mth field.  1.n refers to the nth character from the beginning of the line; if n is greater than the length of the line, the field is taken to be empty. nth positions are always counted from the field beginning, even if the field is shorter than the number of specified positions.  Thus, the key can really start from a position in a subsequent field. A field2 position specified by m.n is interpreted as the nth character (including separators) from the beginning of the mth field.  A missing .n indicates the last character of the mth field; m = 0 designates the end of a line.  Thus the option -k v.x,w.y is synonymous with the obsolete option +v-1.x-1 -w-1.y; when y is omitted, -k v.x,w is synonymous with +v-1.x-1 -w.0.  The obsolete +pos1 -pos2 option is still supported, except for -w.0b, which has no -k equivalent."

Formats Format strings are similar to printf(3) formats in that they start with %, are then followed by a sequence of formatting characters, and end in a character that selects the field of the struct stat which is to be formatted.  If the % is immediately followed by one of n, t, %, or @, then a newline character, a tab character, a percent character, or the current file number is printed, otherwise the string is examined for the following: Any of the following optional flags: #\t     Selects an alternate output form for octal and hexadecimal output.  Non-zero octal output will have a leading zero, and non- zero hexadecimal output will have “0x” prepended to it. +\t     Asserts that a sign indicating whether a number is positive or negative should always be printed.  Non-negative numbers are not usually printed with a sign. -\t     Aligns string output to the left of the field, instead of to the right. 0\t     Sets the fill character for left padding to the ‘0’ character, instead of a space. space   Reserves a space at the front of non-negative signed output fields.  A ‘+’ overrides a space if both are used. Then the following fields: size    An optional decimal digit string specifying the minimum field width. prec    An optional precision composed of a decimal point ‘.’ and a decimal digit string that indicates the maximum string length, the number of digits to appear after the decimal point in floating point output, or the minimum number of digits to appear in numeric output. fmt     An optional output format specifier which is one of D, O, U, X, F, or S.  These represent signed decimal output, octal output, unsigned decimal output, hexadecimal output, floating point output, and string output, respectively.  Some output formats do not apply to all fields.  Floating point output only applies to timespec fields (the a, m, and c fields). The special output specifier S may be used to indicate that the output, if applicable, should be in string format.  May be used in combination with: amc     Display date in strftime(3) format. dr      Display actual device name. f\t     Display the flags of file as in ls -lTdo. gu      Display group or user name. p\t     Display the mode of file as in ls -lTd. N\t     Displays the name of file. T\t     Displays the type of file. Y\t     Insert a “ -> ” into the output.  Note that the default output format for Y is a string, but if specified explicitly, these four characters are prepended. sub     An optional sub field specifier (high, middle, low).  Only applies to the p, d, r, and T output formats.  It can be one of the following: H\t     “High” — specifies the major number for devices from r or d, the “user” bits for permissions from the string form of p, the file “type” bits from the numeric forms of p, and the long output form of T. L\t     “Low” — specifies the minor number for devices from r or d, the “other” bits for permissions from the string form of p, the “user”, “group”, and “other” bits from the numeric forms of p, and the ls -F style output character for file type when used with T (the use of L for this is optional). M\t     “Middle” — specifies the “group” bits for permissions from the string output form of p, or the “suid”, “sgid”, and “sticky” bits for the numeric forms of p. datum   A required field specifier, being one of the following: d\t     Device upon which file resides (st_dev). i\t     file's inode number (st_ino). p\t     File type and permissions (st_mode). l\t     Number of hard links to file (st_nlink). u, g    User ID and group ID of file's owner (st_uid, st_gid). r\t     Device number for character and block device special files (st_rdev). a, m, c, B The time file was last accessed or modified, or when the inode was last changed, or the birth time of the inode (st_atime, st_mtime, st_ctime, st_birthtime). z\t     The size of file in bytes (st_size). b\t     Number of blocks allocated for file (st_blocks). k\t     Optimal file system I/O operation block size (st_blksize). f\t     User defined flags for file. v\t     Inode generation number (st_gen). The following five field specifiers are not drawn directly from the data in struct stat, but are: N\t     The name of the file. R\t     The absolute pathname corresponding to the file. T\t     The file type, either as in ls -F or in a more descriptive form if the sub field specifier H is given. Y\t     The target of a symbolic link. Z\t     Expands to “major,minor” from the rdev field for character or block special devices and gives size output for all others. Only the % and the field specifier are required.  Most field specifiers default to U as an output form, with the exception of p which defaults to O; a, m, and c which default to D; and Y, T, and N which default to S. EXIT STATUS The stat and readlink utilities exit 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs."

-e option described below is implied security policies and audit plugins may log successful and failed attempts to run sudo if an i o plugin is configured the running command s input and output may be logged as well the options are as follows update the user s cached credentials authenticating the user if necessary for the sudoers plugin this extends the sudo timeout for another 5 minutes by default but does not run a command not all security policies support cached credentials -- the -- is used to delimit the end of the sudo options subsequent options are passed to the command options that take a value may only be specified once unless otherwise indicated in the description this is to help guard against problems caused by poorly written scripts that invoke sudo with user-controlled input environment variables to be set for the command may also be passed as options to sudo in the form var value for example ld library path usr local pkg lib environment variables may be subject to restrictions imposed by the security policy plugin the sudoers policy subjects environment variables passed as options to the same restrictions as existing environment variables with one important difference if the setenv option is set in sudoers the command to be run has the setenv tag set or the command matched is all the user may set variables that would otherwise be forbidden see sudoers 5 for more information command execution when sudo executes a command the security policy specifies the execution environment for the command typically the real and effective user and group and ids are set to match those of the target user as specified in the password database and the group vector is initialized based on the group database unless the -p option was specified the following parameters may be specified by security policy real and effective user-id real and effective group-id supplementary group-ids the environment list current working directory file creation mode mask umask scheduling priority aka nice value process model there are two distinct ways sudo can run a command if an i o logging plugin is configured to log terminal i o or if the security policy explicitly requests it a new pseudo-terminal pty is allocated and fork 2 is used to create a second sudo process referred to as the monitor the monitor creates a new terminal session with itself as the leader and the pty as its controlling terminal calls fork 2 again sets up the execution environment as described above and then uses the execve 2 system call to run the command in the child process the monitor exists to relay job control signals between the user s terminal and the pty the command is being run in this makes it possible to suspend and resume the command normally without the monitor the command would be in what posix terms an orphaned process group and it would not receive any job control signals from the kernel when the command exits or is terminated by a signal the monitor passes the command s exit status to the main sudo process and exits after receiving the command s exit status the main sudo process passes the command s exit status to the security policy s close function as well as the close function of any configured audit plugin and exits if no pty is used sudo calls fork 2 sets up the execution environment as described above and uses the execve 2 system call to run the command in the child process the main sudo process waits until the command has completed then passes the command s exit status to the security policy s close function as well as the close function of any configured audit plugins and exits as a special case if the policy plugin does not define a close function sudo will execute the command directly instead of calling fork 2 first the sudoers policy plugin will only define a close function when i o logging is enabled a pty is required an selinux role is specified the command has an associated timeout or the pam session or pam setcred options are enabled both pam session and pam setcred are enabled by default on systems using pam on systems that use pam the security policy s close function is responsible for closing the pam session it may also log the command s exit status signal handling when the command is run as a child of the sudo process sudo will relay signals it receives to the command the sigint and sigquit signals are only relayed when the command is being run in a new pty or when the signal was sent by a user process not the kernel this prevents the command from receiving sigint twice each time the user enters control- c some signals such as sigstop and sigkill cannot be caught and thus will not be relayed to the command as a general rule sigtstp should be used instead of sigstop when you wish to suspend a command being run by sudo as a special case sudo will not relay signals that were sent by the command it is running this prevents the command from accidentally killing itself on some systems the reboot 8 utility sends sigterm to all non-system processes other than itself before rebooting the system this prevents sudo from relaying the sigterm signal it received back to reboot 8 which might then exit before the system was actually rebooted leaving it in a half-dead state similar to single user mode note however that this check only applies to the command run by sudo and not any other processes that the command may create as a result running a script that calls reboot 8 or shutdown 8 via sudo may cause the system to end up in this undefined state unless the reboot 8 or shutdown 8 are run using the exec family of functions instead of system which interposes a shell between the command and the calling process plugins plugins may be specified via plugin directives in the sudo conf 5 file they may be loaded as dynamic shared objects on systems that support them or compiled directly into the sudo binary if no sudo conf 5 file is present or if it doesn t contain any plugin lines sudo will use sudoers 5 for the policy auditing and i o logging plugins see the sudo conf 5 manual for details of the private etc sudo conf file and the sudo plugin 5 manual for more information about the sudo plugin architecture exit value upon successful execution of a command the exit status from sudo will be the exit status of the program that was executed if the command terminated due to receipt of a signal sudo will send itself the same signal that terminated the command if the -l option was specified without a command sudo will exit with a value of 0 if the user is allowed to run sudo and they authenticated successfully as required by the security policy if a command is specified with the -l option the exit value will only be 0 if the command is permitted by the security policy otherwise it will be 1 if there is an authentication failure a configuration permission problem or if the given command cannot be executed sudo exits with a value of 1 in the latter case the error string is printed to the standard error if sudo cannot stat 2 one or more entries in the user s path an error is printed to the standard error if the directory does not exist or if it is not really a directory the entry is ignored and no error is printed this should not happen under normal circumstances the most common reason for stat 2 to return permission denied is if you are running an automounter and one of the directories in your path is on a machine that is currently unreachable security notes sudo tries to be safe when executing external commands to prevent command spoofing sudo checks and both denoting current directory last when searching for a command in the user s path if one or both are in the path depending on the security policy the user s path environment variable may be modified replaced or passed unchanged to the program that sudo executes users should never be granted sudo privileges to execute files that are writable by the user or that reside in a directory that is writable by the user if the user can modify or replace the command there is no way to limit what additional commands they can run by default sudo will only log the command it explicitly runs if a user runs a command such as sudo su or sudo sh subsequent commands run from that shell are not subject to sudo s security policy the same is true for commands that offer shell escapes including most editors if i o logging is enabled subsequent commands will have their input and or output logged but there will not be traditional logs for those commands because of this care must be taken when giving users access to commands via sudo to verify that the command does not inadvertently give the user an effective root shell for information on ways to address this see the preventing shell escapes section in sudoers 5 to prevent the disclosure of potentially sensitive information sudo disables core dumps by default while it is executing they are re- enabled for the command that is run this historical practice dates from a time when most operating systems allowed set-user-id processes to dump core by default to aid in debugging sudo crashes you may wish to re-enable core dumps by setting disable coredump to false in the sudo conf 5 file as follows set disable coredump false see the sudo conf 5 manual for more information -a --askpass normally if sudo requires a password it will read it from the user s terminal if the -a askpass option is specified a possibly graphical helper program is executed to read the user s password and output the password to the standard output if the sudo askpass environment variable is set it specifies the path to the helper program otherwise if sudo conf 5 contains a line specifying the askpass program that value will be used for example path to askpass helper program path askpass usr x11r6 bin ssh-askpass if no askpass program is available sudo will exit with an error -a type --auth-type type use the specified bsd authentication type when validating the user if allowed by etc login conf the system administrator may specify a list of sudo-specific authentication methods by adding an auth-sudo entry in etc login conf this option is only available on systems that support bsd authentication -b --bell ring the bell as part of the password prompt when a terminal is present this option has no effect if an askpass program is used -b --background run the given command in the background it is not possible to use shell job control to manipulate background processes started by sudo most interactive commands will fail to work properly in background mode -c close all file descriptors greater than or equal to num before executing a command values less than three are not permitted by default sudo will close all open file descriptors other than standard input standard output and standard error when executing a command the security policy may restrict the user s ability to use this option the sudoers policy only permits use of the -c option when the administrator has enabled the closefrom override option -c class --login-class class run the command with resource limits and scheduling priority of the specified login class the class argument can be either a class name as defined in etc login conf or a single - character if class is - the default login class of the target user will be used otherwise the command must be run as the superuser user-id 0 or sudo must be run from a shell that is already running as the superuser if the command is being run as a login shell additional etc login conf settings such as the umask and environment variables will be applied if present this option is only available on systems with bsd login classes -d run the command in the specified directory instead of the current working directory the security policy may return an error if the user does not have permission to specify the working directory --preserve-env list indicates to the security policy that the user wishes to add the comma-separated list of environment variables to those preserved from the user s environment the security policy may return an error if the user does not have permission to preserve the environment this option may be specified multiple times -e --edit edit one or more files instead of running a command in lieu of a path name the string sudoedit is used when consulting the security policy if the user is authorized by the policy the following steps are taken 1 temporary copies are made of the files to be edited with the owner set to the invoking user 2 the editor specified by the policy is run to edit the temporary files the sudoers policy uses the sudo editor visual and editor environment variables in that order if none of sudo editor visual or editor are set the first program listed in the editor sudoers 5 option is used 3 if they have been modified the temporary files are copied back to their original location and the temporary versions are removed to help prevent the editing of unauthorized files the following restrictions are enforced unless explicitly allowed by the security policy symbolic links may not be edited version 1 8 15 and higher symbolic links along the path to be edited are not followed when the parent directory is writable by the invoking user unless that user is root version 1 8 16 and higher files located in a directory that is writable by the invoking user may not be edited unless that user is root version 1 8 16 and higher users are never allowed to edit device special files if the specified file does not exist it will be created unlike most commands run by sudo the editor is run with the invoking user s environment unmodified if the temporary file becomes empty after editing the user will be prompted before it is installed if for some reason sudo is unable to update a file with its edited version the user will receive a warning and the edited copy will remain in a temporary file -g run the command with the primary group set to group instead of the primary group specified by the target user s password database entry the group may be either a group name or a numeric group-id gid prefixed with the character e g 0 for gid 0 when running a command as a gid many shells require that the be escaped with a backslash if no -u user in either case the primary group will be set to group the sudoers policy permits any of the target user s groups to be specified via the -g option as long as the -p option is not in use run the command as a user other than the default target user usually root the user may be either a user name or a numeric user-id uid prefixed with the character e g 0 for uid 0 when running commands as a uid many shells require that the be escaped with a backslash some security policies may restrict uids to those listed in the password database the sudoers policy allows uids that are not in the password database as long as the targetpw option is not set other security policies may not support this -h --set-home request that the security policy set the home environment variable to the home directory specified by the target user s password database entry depending on the policy this may be the default behavior -h display a short help message to the standard output and exit run the command on the specified host if the security policy plugin supports remote commands the sudoers plugin does not currently support running remote commands this may also be used in conjunction with the -l option to list a user s privileges for the remote host -h display a short help message to the standard output and exit run the command on the specified host if the security policy plugin supports remote commands the sudoers plugin does not currently support running remote commands this may also be used in conjunction with the -l option to list a user s privileges for the remote host -i run the shell specified by the target user s password database entry as a login shell this means that login-specific resource files such as profile bash profile or login will be read by the shell if a command is specified it is passed to the shell as a simple command using the -c option the command and any args are concatenated separated by spaces after escaping each character including white space with a backslash except for alphanumerics underscores hyphens and dollar signs if no command is specified an interactive shell is executed sudo attempts to change to that user s home directory before running the shell the command is run with an environment similar to the one a user would receive at log in most shells behave differently when a command is specified as compared to an interactive session consult the shell s manual for details the command environment section in the sudoers 5 manual documents how the -i option affects the environment in which a command is run when the sudoers policy is in use -k similar to the -k option except that it removes every cached credential for the user regardless of the terminal or parent process id the next time sudo is run a password must be entered if the security policy requires authentication it is not possible to use the -k option in conjunction with a command or other option this option does not require a password not all security policies support credential caching -k when used without a command invalidates the user s cached credentials for the current session the next time sudo is run in the session a password must be entered if the security policy requires authentication by default the sudoers policy uses a separate record in the credential cache for each terminal or parent process id if no terminal is present this prevents the -k option from interfering with sudo commands run in a different terminal session see the timestamp type option in sudoers 5 for more information this option does not require a password and was added to allow a user to revoke sudo permissions from a logout file when used in conjunction with a command or an option that may require a password this option will cause sudo to ignore the user s cached credentials as a result sudo will prompt for a password if one is required by the security policy and will not update the user s cached credentials not all security policies support credential caching -l if no command is specified list the privileges for the invoking user or the user specified by the -u option on the current host a longer list format is used if this option is specified multiple times and the security policy supports a verbose output

a command if an i o logging plugin is configured to log terminal i o or if the security policy explicitly requests it a new pseudo-terminal pty is allocated and fork 2 is used to create a second sudo process referred to as the monitor the monitor creates a new terminal session with itself as the leader and the pty as its controlling terminal calls fork 2 again sets up the execution environment as described above and then uses the execve 2 system call to run the command in the child process the monitor exists to relay job control signals between the user s terminal and the pty the command is being run in this makes it possible to suspend and resume the command normally without the monitor the command would be in what posix terms an orphaned process group and it would not receive any job control signals from the kernel when the command exits or is terminated by a signal the monitor passes the command s exit status to the main sudo process and exits after receiving the command s exit status the main sudo process passes the command s exit status to the security policy s close function as well as the close function of any configured audit plugin and exits if no pty is used sudo calls fork 2 sets up the execution environment as described above and uses the execve 2 system call to run the command in the child process the main sudo process waits until the command has completed then passes the command s exit status to the security policy s close function as well as the close function of any configured audit plugins and exits as a special case if the policy plugin does not define a close function sudo will execute the command directly instead of calling fork 2 first the sudoers policy plugin will only define a close function when i o logging is enabled a pty is required an selinux role is specified the command has an associated timeout or the pam session or pam setcred options are enabled both pam session and pam setcred are enabled by default on systems using pam on systems that use pam the security policy s close function is responsible for closing the pam session it may also log the command s exit status signal handling when the command is run as a child of the sudo process sudo will relay signals it receives to the command the sigint and sigquit signals are only relayed when the command is being run in a new pty or when the signal was sent by a user process not the kernel this prevents the command from receiving sigint twice each time the user enters control- c some signals such as sigstop and sigkill cannot be caught and thus will not be relayed to the command as a general rule sigtstp should be used instead of sigstop when you wish to suspend a command being run by sudo as a special case sudo will not relay signals that were sent by the command it is running this prevents the command from accidentally killing itself on some systems the reboot 8 utility sends sigterm to all non-system processes other than itself before rebooting the system this prevents sudo from relaying the sigterm signal it received back to reboot 8 which might then exit before the system was actually rebooted leaving it in a half-dead state similar to single user mode note however that this check only applies to the command run by sudo and not any other processes that the command may create as a result running a script that calls reboot 8 or shutdown 8 via sudo may cause the system to end up in this undefined state unless the reboot 8 or shutdown 8 are run using the exec family of functions instead of system which interposes a shell between the command and the calling process plugins plugins may be specified via plugin directives in the sudo conf 5 file they may be loaded as dynamic shared objects on systems that support them or compiled directly into the sudo binary if no sudo conf 5 file is present or if it doesn t contain any plugin lines sudo will use sudoers 5 for the policy auditing and i o logging plugins see the sudo conf 5 manual for details of the private etc sudo conf file and the sudo plugin 5 manual for more information about the sudo plugin architecture exit value upon successful execution of a command the exit status from sudo will be the exit status of the program that was executed if the command terminated due to receipt of a signal sudo will send itself the same signal that terminated the command if the -l option was specified without a command sudo will exit with a value of 0 if the user is allowed to run sudo and they authenticated successfully as required by the security policy if a command is specified with the -l option the exit value will only be 0 if the command is permitted by the security policy otherwise it will be 1 if there is an authentication failure a configuration permission problem or if the given command cannot be executed sudo exits with a value of 1 in the latter case the error string is printed to the standard error if sudo cannot stat 2 one or more entries in the user s path an error is printed to the standard error if the directory does not exist or if it is not really a directory the entry is ignored and no error is printed this should not happen under normal circumstances the most common reason for stat 2 to return permission denied is if you are running an automounter and one of the directories in your path is on a machine that is currently unreachable security notes sudo tries to be safe when executing external commands to prevent command spoofing sudo checks and both denoting current directory last when searching for a command in the user s path if one or both are in

privileges to execute files that are writable by the user or that reside in a directory that is writable by the user if the user can modify or replace the command there is no way to limit what additional commands they can run by default sudo will only log the command it explicitly runs if a user runs a command such as sudo su or sudo sh subsequent commands run from that shell are not subject to sudo s security policy the same is true for commands that offer shell escapes including most editors if i o logging is enabled subsequent commands will have their input and or output logged but there will not be traditional logs for those commands because of this care must be taken when giving users access to commands via sudo to verify that the command does not inadvertently give the user an effective root shell for information on ways to address this see the preventing shell escapes section in sudoers 5 to prevent the disclosure of potentially sensitive information sudo disables

        "description": " command. On systems where sudo is the primary method of gaining superuser privileges, it is imperative to avoid syntax errors in the security policy configuration files.  For the default security policy, sudoers(5), changes to the configuration files should be made using the visudo(8) utility which will ensure that no syntax errors are introduced. When invoked as sudoedit, the -e option (described below), is implied. Security policies and audit plugins may log successful and failed attempts to run sudo.  If an I/O plugin is configured, the running command's input and output may be logged as well. The options are as follows: Update the user's cached credentials, authenticating the user if necessary.  For the sudoers plugin, this extends the sudo timeout for another 5 minutes by default, but does not run a command.  Not all security policies support cached credentials. --      The -- is used to delimit the end of the sudo options. Subsequent options are passed to the command. Options that take a value may only be specified once unless otherwise indicated in the description.  This is to help guard against problems caused by poorly written scripts that invoke sudo with user-controlled input. Environment variables to be set for the command may also be passed as options to sudo in the form VAR=value, for example LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/pkg/lib.  Environment variables may be subject to restrictions imposed by the security policy plugin.  The sudoers policy subjects environment variables passed as options to the same restrictions as existing environment variables with one important difference.  If the setenv option is set in sudoers, the command to be run has the SETENV tag set or the command matched is ALL, the user may set variables that would otherwise be forbidden.  See sudoers(5) for more information. COMMAND EXECUTION When sudo executes a command, the security policy specifies the execution environment for the command.  Typically, the real and effective user and group and IDs are set to match those of the target user, as specified in the password database, and the group vector is initialized based on the group database (unless the -P option was specified). The following parameters may be specified by security policy: •  real and effective user-ID •  real and effective group-ID •  supplementary group-IDs •  the environment list •  current working directory •  file creation mode mask (umask) •  scheduling priority (aka nice value) Process model There are two distinct ways sudo can run a command. If an I/O logging plugin is configured to log terminal I/O, or if the security policy explicitly requests it, a new pseudo-terminal (“pty”) is allocated and fork(2) is used to create a second sudo process, referred to as the monitor.  The monitor creates a new terminal session with itself as the leader and the pty as its controlling terminal, calls fork(2) again, sets up the execution environment as described above, and then uses the execve(2) system call to run the command in the child process.  The monitor exists to relay job control signals between the user's terminal and the pty the command is being run in. This makes it possible to suspend and resume the command normally. Without the monitor, the command would be in what POSIX terms an “orphaned process group” and it would not receive any job control signals from the kernel.  When the command exits or is terminated by a signal, the monitor passes the command's exit status to the main sudo process and exits.  After receiving the command's exit status, the main sudo process passes the command's exit status to the security policy's close function, as well as the close function of any configured audit plugin, and exits. If no pty is used, sudo calls fork(2), sets up the execution environment as described above, and uses the execve(2) system call to run the command in the child process.  The main sudo process waits until the command has completed, then passes the command's exit status to the security policy's close function, as well as the close function of any configured audit plugins, and exits.  As a special case, if the policy plugin does not define a close function, sudo will execute the command directly instead of calling fork(2) first.  The sudoers policy plugin will only define a close function when I/O logging is enabled, a pty is required, an SELinux role is specified, the command has an associated timeout, or the pam_session or pam_setcred options are enabled.  Both pam_session and pam_setcred are enabled by default on systems using PAM. On systems that use PAM, the security policy's close function is responsible for closing the PAM session.  It may also log the command's exit status. Signal handling When the command is run as a child of the sudo process, sudo will relay signals it receives to the command.  The SIGINT and SIGQUIT signals are only relayed when the command is being run in a new pty or when the signal was sent by a user process, not the kernel.  This prevents the command from receiving SIGINT twice each time the user enters control- C.  Some signals, such as SIGSTOP and SIGKILL, cannot be caught and thus will not be relayed to the command.  As a general rule, SIGTSTP should be used instead of SIGSTOP when you wish to suspend a command being run by sudo. As a special case, sudo will not relay signals that were sent by the command it is running.  This prevents the command from accidentally killing itself.\tOn some systems, the reboot(8) utility sends SIGTERM to all non-system processes other than itself before rebooting the system.\tThis prevents sudo from relaying the SIGTERM signal it received back to reboot(8), which might then exit before the system was actually rebooted, leaving it in a half-dead state similar to single user mode.  Note, however, that this check only applies to the command run by sudo and not any other processes that the command may create. As a result, running a script that calls reboot(8) or shutdown(8) via sudo may cause the system to end up in this undefined state unless the reboot(8) or shutdown(8) are run using the exec() family of functions instead of system() (which interposes a shell between the command and the calling process). Plugins Plugins may be specified via Plugin directives in the sudo.conf(5) file.  They may be loaded as dynamic shared objects (on systems that support them), or compiled directly into the sudo binary.  If no sudo.conf(5) file is present, or if it doesn't contain any Plugin lines, sudo will use sudoers(5) for the policy, auditing, and I/O logging plugins.  See the sudo.conf(5) manual for details of the /private/etc/sudo.conf file and the sudo_plugin(5) manual for more information about the sudo plugin architecture. EXIT VALUE Upon successful execution of a command, the exit status from sudo will be the exit status of the program that was executed.  If the command terminated due to receipt of a signal, sudo will send itself the same signal that terminated the command. If the -l option was specified without a command, sudo will exit with a value of 0 if the user is allowed to run sudo and they authenticated successfully (as required by the security policy).  If a command is specified with the -l option, the exit value will only be 0 if the command is permitted by the security policy, otherwise it will be 1. If there is an authentication failure, a configuration/permission problem, or if the given command cannot be executed, sudo exits with a value of 1.  In the latter case, the error string is printed to the standard error.\tIf sudo cannot stat(2) one or more entries in the user's PATH, an error is printed to the standard error.\t(If the directory does not exist or if it is not really a directory, the entry is ignored and no error is printed.)  This should not happen under normal circumstances.  The most common reason for stat(2) to return “permission denied” is if you are running an automounter and one of the directories in your PATH is on a machine that is currently unreachable. SECURITY NOTES sudo tries to be safe when executing external commands. To prevent command spoofing, sudo checks \".\" and \"\" (both denoting current directory) last when searching for a command in the user's PATH (if one or both are in the PATH).  Depending on the security policy, the user's PATH environment variable may be modified, replaced, or passed unchanged to the program that sudo executes. Users should never be granted sudo privileges to execute files that are writable by the user or that reside in a directory that is writable by the user.  If the user can modify or replace the command there is no way to limit what additional commands they can run. By default, sudo will only log the command it explicitly runs.  If a user runs a command such as ‘sudo su’ or ‘sudo sh’, subsequent commands run from that shell are not subject to sudo's security policy.  The same is true for commands that offer shell escapes (including most editors).  If I/O logging is enabled, subsequent commands will have their input and/or output logged, but there will not be traditional logs for those commands.  Because of this, care must be taken when giving users access to commands via sudo to verify that the command does not inadvertently give the user an effective root shell.  For information on ways to address this, see the Preventing shell escapes section in sudoers(5). To prevent the disclosure of potentially sensitive information, sudo disables core dumps by default while it is executing (they are re- enabled for the command that is run).  This historical practice dates from a time when most operating systems allowed set-user-ID processes to dump core by default.  To aid in debugging sudo crashes, you may wish to re-enable core dumps by setting “disable_coredump” to false in the sudo.conf(5) file as follows: Set disable_coredump false See the sudo.conf(5) manual for more information."

For the default security policy, sudoers(5), changes to the configuration files should be made using the visudo(8) utility which will ensure that no syntax errors are introduced. When invoked as sudoedit, the -e option (described below), is implied. Security policies and audit plugins may log successful and failed attempts to run sudo.  If an I/O plugin is configured, the running command's input and output may be logged as well. The options are as follows: Update the user's cached credentials, authenticating the user if necessary.  For the sudoers plugin, this extends the sudo timeout for another 5 minutes by default, but does not run a command.  Not all security policies support cached credentials. --      The -- is used to delimit the end of the sudo options. Subsequent options are passed to the command. Options that take a value may only be specified once unless otherwise indicated in the description.  This is to help guard against problems caused by poorly written scripts that invoke sudo with user-controlled input. Environment variables to be set for the command may also be passed as options to sudo in the form VAR=value, for example LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/pkg/lib.  Environment variables may be subject to restrictions imposed by the security policy plugin.  The sudoers policy subjects environment variables passed as options to the same restrictions as existing environment variables with one important difference.  If the setenv option is set in sudoers, the command to be run has the SETENV tag set or the command matched is ALL, the user may set variables that would otherwise be forbidden.  See sudoers(5) for more information. COMMAND EXECUTION When sudo executes a command, the security policy specifies the execution environment for the command.  Typically, the real and effective user and group and IDs are set to match those of the target user, as specified in the password database, and the group vector is initialized based on the group database (unless the -P option was specified). The following parameters may be specified by security policy: •  real and effective user-ID •  real and effective group-ID •  supplementary group-IDs •  the environment list •  current working directory •  file creation mode mask (umask) •  scheduling priority (aka nice value) Process model There are two distinct ways sudo can run a command. If an I/O logging plugin is configured to log terminal I/O, or if the security policy explicitly requests it, a new pseudo-terminal (“pty”) is allocated and fork(2) is used to create a second sudo process, referred to as the monitor.  The monitor creates a new terminal session with itself as the leader and the pty as its controlling terminal, calls fork(2) again, sets up the execution environment as described above, and then uses the execve(2) system call to run the command in the child process.  The monitor exists to relay job control signals between the user's terminal and the pty the command is being run in. This makes it possible to suspend and resume the command normally. Without the monitor, the command would be in what POSIX terms an “orphaned process group” and it would not receive any job control signals from the kernel.  When the command exits or is terminated by a signal, the monitor passes the command's exit status to the main sudo process and exits.  After receiving the command's exit status, the main sudo process passes the command's exit status to the security policy's close function, as well as the close function of any configured audit plugin, and exits. If no pty is used, sudo calls fork(2), sets up the execution environment as described above, and uses the execve(2) system call to run the command in the child process.  The main sudo process waits until the command has completed, then passes the command's exit status to the security policy's close function, as well as the close function of any configured audit plugins, and exits.  As a special case, if the policy plugin does not define a close function, sudo will execute the command directly instead of calling fork(2) first.  The sudoers policy plugin will only define a close function when I/O logging is enabled, a pty is required, an SELinux role is specified, the command has an associated timeout, or the pam_session or pam_setcred options are enabled.  Both pam_session and pam_setcred are enabled by default on systems using PAM. On systems that use PAM, the security policy's close function is responsible for closing the PAM session.  It may also log the command's exit status. Signal handling When the command is run as a child of the sudo process, sudo will relay signals it receives to the command.  The SIGINT and SIGQUIT signals are only relayed when the command is being run in a new pty or when the signal was sent by a user process, not the kernel.  This prevents the command from receiving SIGINT twice each time the user enters control- C.  Some signals, such as SIGSTOP and SIGKILL, cannot be caught and thus will not be relayed to the command.  As a general rule, SIGTSTP should be used instead of SIGSTOP when you wish to suspend a command being run by sudo. As a special case, sudo will not relay signals that were sent by the command it is running.  This prevents the command from accidentally killing itself.\tOn some systems, the reboot(8) utility sends SIGTERM to all non-system processes other than itself before rebooting the system.\tThis prevents sudo from relaying the SIGTERM signal it received back to reboot(8), which might then exit before the system was actually rebooted, leaving it in a half-dead state similar to single user mode.  Note, however, that this check only applies to the command run by sudo and not any other processes that the command may create. As a result, running a script that calls reboot(8) or shutdown(8) via sudo may cause the system to end up in this undefined state unless the reboot(8) or shutdown(8) are run using the exec() family of functions instead of system() (which interposes a shell between the command and the calling process). Plugins Plugins may be specified via Plugin directives in the sudo.conf(5) file.  They may be loaded as dynamic shared objects (on systems that support them), or compiled directly into the sudo binary.  If no sudo.conf(5) file is present, or if it doesn't contain any Plugin lines, sudo will use sudoers(5) for the policy, auditing, and I/O logging plugins.  See the sudo.conf(5) manual for details of the /private/etc/sudo.conf file and the sudo_plugin(5) manual for more information about the sudo plugin architecture. EXIT VALUE Upon successful execution of a command, the exit status from sudo will be the exit status of the program that was executed.  If the command terminated due to receipt of a signal, sudo will send itself the same signal that terminated the command. If the -l option was specified without a command, sudo will exit with a value of 0 if the user is allowed to run sudo and they authenticated successfully (as required by the security policy).  If a command is specified with the -l option, the exit value will only be 0 if the command is permitted by the security policy, otherwise it will be 1. If there is an authentication failure, a configuration/permission problem, or if the given command cannot be executed, sudo exits with a value of 1.  In the latter case, the error string is printed to the standard error.\tIf sudo cannot stat(2) one or more entries in the user's PATH, an error is printed to the standard error.\t(If the directory does not exist or if it is not really a directory, the entry is ignored and no error is printed.)  This should not happen under normal circumstances.  The most common reason for stat(2) to return “permission denied” is if you are running an automounter and one of the directories in your PATH is on a machine that is currently unreachable. SECURITY NOTES sudo tries to be safe when executing external commands. To prevent command spoofing, sudo checks \".\" and \"\" (both denoting current directory) last when searching for a command in the user's PATH (if one or both are in the PATH).  Depending on the security policy, the user's PATH environment variable may be modified, replaced, or passed unchanged to the program that sudo executes. Users should never be granted sudo privileges to execute files that are writable by the user or that reside in a directory that is writable by the user.  If the user can modify or replace the command there is no way to limit what additional commands they can run. By default, sudo will only log the command it explicitly runs.  If a user runs a command such as ‘sudo su’ or ‘sudo sh’, subsequent commands run from that shell are not subject to sudo's security policy.  The same is true for commands that offer shell escapes (including most editors).  If I/O logging is enabled, subsequent commands will have their input and/or output logged, but there will not be traditional logs for those commands.  Because of this, care must be taken when giving users access to commands via sudo to verify that the command does not inadvertently give the user an effective root shell.  For information on ways to address this, see the Preventing shell escapes section in sudoers(5). To prevent the disclosure of potentially sensitive information, sudo disables core dumps by default while it is executing (they are re- enabled for the command that is run).  This historical practice dates from a time when most operating systems allowed set-user-ID processes to dump core by default.  To aid in debugging sudo crashes, you may wish to re-enable core dumps by setting “disable_coredump” to false in the sudo.conf(5) file as follows: Set disable_coredump false See the sudo.conf(5) manual for more information."

specified value in every module that supports it modules that do not support this key will ignore it key the key will be enabled in every module that supports it this is equivalent to key 1 key the key will be disabled in every module that supports it module key value module key module key as above but the corresponding key and value will be provided only to modules whose name matches module the complete list of supported modules and keys for create and append modes is in archive write set options 3 and for extract and list modes in archive read set options 3 examples of supported options

lz4 block-dependence use the previous block of the block being compressed for a compression dictionary to improve compression ratio zstd compression-level n a decimal integer specifying the zstd compression level supported values depend on the library version common values are from 1 to 22 zstd threads n specify the number of worker threads to use or 0 to use as many threads as there are cpu cores in the system zstd frame-per-file start a new compression frame at the beginning of each file in the archive zstd min-frame-in n in combination with zstd frame-per-file do not start a new compression frame unless the uncompressed size of the current frame is at least n bytes the number may be followed by k kb m mb or g gb to indicate kilobytes megabytes or gigabytes respectively zstd min-frame-out n zstd min-frame-size n in combination with zstd frame-per-file do not start a new compression frame unless the compressed size of the current frame is at least n bytes the number may be

zip encryption zip encryption type use type as encryption type supported values are zipcrypt traditional zip encryption aes128 winzip aes-128 encryption and aes256 winzip aes-256 encryption read concatenated archives ignore zeroed blocks in the archive which occurs when multiple tar archives have been concatenated together without this option only the contents of the first concatenated archive would be read this option is comparable to the -i --ignore-zeros option of gnu tar if a provided option is not supported by any module that is a fatal error -p --absolute-paths preserve pathnames by default absolute pathnames those that begin with a character have the leading slash removed both when creating archives and extracting from them also tar will refuse to extract archive entries whose pathnames contain or whose target directory would be altered by a symlink this option suppresses these behaviors --no-same-permissions and the default if tar is being run as root it can be partially overridden by also specifying --no-acls --no-fflags --no-mac-metadata or --no-xattrs --passphrase passphrase the passphrase is used to extract or create an encrypted archive currently zip is the only supported format that supports encryption you shouldn t use this option unless you realize how insecure use of this option is --posix c r u mode only synonym for --format pax --read-sparse c r u modes only read sparse file information from disk this is the reverse of --no-read-sparse and the default behavior -s x mode only extract files as sparse files for every block on disk check first if it contains only null bytes and seek over it otherwise this works similar to the conv sparse option of dd --safe-writes x mode only extract files atomically by default tar unlinks the original file with the same name as the extracted file if it exists and then creates it immediately under the same name and writes to it for a short period of time applications trying to access the file might not find it or see incomplete results if --safe-writes is enabled tar first creates a unique temporary file then writes the new contents to the temporary file and finally renames the temporary file to its final name atomically using rename 2 this guarantees that an application accessing the file will either see the old contents or the new contents at all times --same-owner x mode only extract owner and group ids this is the reverse of --no-same-owner and the default behavior if tar is run as root --strip-components count remove the specified number of leading path elements pathnames with fewer elements will be silently skipped note that the pathname is edited after checking inclusion exclusion patterns but before security checks --totals c r u modes only after archiving all files print a summary to stderr --uid id use the provided user id number and ignore the user name from the archive on create if --uname is not also specified the user name will be set to match the user id --uname name use the provided user name on extract this overrides the user name in the archive if the provided user name does not exist on the system it will be ignored and the user id from the archive or from the --uid option will be used instead on create this sets the user name that will be stored in the archive the name is not verified against the system user database --use-compress-program program pipe the input in x or t mode or the output in c mode through program instead of using the builtin compression support --owner name uid use the provided user if uid is not provided name can be either an username or numeric id see the --uname option for details --version print version of tar and libarchive and exit -w --confirmation --interactive ask for confirmation for every action --exclude for more information about the handling of exclusions --xattrs c r u x modes only archive or extract extended file attributes this is the reverse of --no-xattrs and the default behavior in c r and u modes or if tar is run in x mode as root -y c mode only compress the resulting archive with bzip2 1 in extract or list modes this option is ignored note that this tar implementation recognizes bzip2 compression automatically when reading archives -z --compress --uncompress c mode only compress the resulting archive with compress 1 in extract or list modes this

These are passed to the modules that handle particular formats to control how those formats will behave.  Each option has one of the following forms: key=value The key will be set to the specified value in every module that supports it.  Modules that do not support this key will ignore it. key     The key will be enabled in every module that supports it. This is equivalent to key=1. !key    The key will be disabled in every module that supports it. module:key=value, module:key, module:!key As above, but the corresponding key and value will be provided only to modules whose name matches module. The complete list of supported modules and keys for create and append modes is in archive_write_set_options(3) and for extract and list modes in archive_read_set_options(3). Examples of supported options: iso9660:joliet Support Joliet extensions.  This is enabled by default, use !joliet or iso9660:!joliet to disable. iso9660:rockridge Support Rock Ridge extensions.  This is enabled by default, use !rockridge or iso9660:!rockridge to disable. gzip:compression-level A decimal integer from 1 to 9 specifying the gzip compression level. gzip:timestamp Store timestamp.  This is enabled by default, use !timestamp or gzip:!timestamp to disable. lrzip:compression=type Use type as compression method.  Supported values are bzip2, gzip, lzo (ultra fast), and zpaq (best, extremely slow). lrzip:compression-level A decimal integer from 1 to 9 specifying the lrzip compression level. lz4:compression-level A decimal integer from 1 to 9 specifying the lzop compression level. lz4:stream-checksum Enable stream checksum.  This is by default, use lz4:!stream-checksum to disable. lz4:block-checksum Enable block checksum (Disabled by default). lz4:block-size A decimal integer from 4 to 7 specifying the lz4 compression block size (7 is set by default). lz4:block-dependence Use the previous block of the block being compressed for a compression dictionary to improve compression ratio. zstd:compression-level=N A decimal integer specifying the zstd compression level. Supported values depend on the library version, common values are from 1 to 22. zstd:threads=N Specify the number of worker threads to use, or 0 to use as many threads as there are CPU cores in the system. zstd:frame-per-file Start a new compression frame at the beginning of each file in the archive. zstd:min-frame-in=N In combination with zstd:frame-per-file, do not start a new compression frame unless the uncompressed size of the current frame is at least N bytes.  The number may be followed by k / kB, M / MB, or G / GB to indicate kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes respectively. zstd:min-frame-out=N, zstd:min-frame-size=N In combination with zstd:frame-per-file, do not start a new compression frame unless the compressed size of the current frame is at least N bytes.  The number may be followed by k / kB, M / MB, or G / GB to indicate kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes respectively. zstd:max-frame-in=N, zstd:max-frame-size=N Start a new compression frame as soon as possible after the uncompressed size of the current frame exceeds N bytes.  The number may be followed by k / kB, M / MB, or G / GB to indicate kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes respectively.  Values less than 1,024 will be rejected. zstd:max-frame-out=N Start a new compression frame as soon as possible after the compressed size of the current frame exceeds N bytes. The number may be followed by k / kB, M / MB, or G / GB to indicate kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes respectively.  Values less than 1,024 will be rejected. lzop:compression-level A decimal integer from 1 to 9 specifying the lzop compression level. xz:compression-level A decimal integer from 0 to 9 specifying the xz compression level. xz:threads Specify the number of worker threads to use.  Setting threads to a special value 0 makes xz(1) use as many threads as there are CPU cores on the system. mtree:keyword The mtree writer module allows you to specify which mtree keywords will be included in the output.  Supported keywords include: cksum, device, flags, gid, gname, indent, link, md5, mode, nlink, rmd160, sha1, sha256, sha384, sha512, size, time, uid, uname.  The default is equivalent to: “device, flags, gid, gname, link, mode, nlink, size, time, type, uid, uname”. mtree:all Enables all of the above keywords.  You can also use mtree:!all to disable all keywords. mtree:use-set Enable generation of /set lines in the output. mtree:indent Produce human-readable output by indenting options and splitting lines to fit into 80 columns. zip:compression=type Use type as compression method.  Supported values are store (uncompressed) and deflate (gzip algorithm). zip:encryption Enable encryption using traditional zip encryption. zip:encryption=type Use type as encryption type.  Supported values are zipcrypt (traditional zip encryption), aes128 (WinZip AES-128 encryption) and aes256 (WinZip AES-256 encryption). read_concatenated_archives Ignore zeroed blocks in the archive, which occurs when multiple tar archives have been concatenated together. Without this option, only the contents of the first concatenated archive would be read.  This option is comparable to the -i, --ignore-zeros option of GNU tar.

M-Up, M-Down M-Left, M-Right Resize the current pane in steps of five cells. Key bindings may be changed with the bind-key and unbind-key commands. COMMAND PARSING AND EXECUTION tmux supports a large number of commands which can be used to control its behaviour.  Each command is named and can accept zero or more flags and arguments.  They may be bound to a key with the bind-key command or run from the shell prompt, a shell script, a configuration file or the command prompt.  For example, the same set-option command run from the shell prompt, from ~/.tmux.conf and bound to a key may look like: $ tmux set-option -g status-style bg=cyan set-option -g status-style bg=cyan bind-key C set-option -g status-style bg=cyan Here, the command name is ‘set-option’, ‘-g’ is a flag and ‘status-style’ and ‘bg=cyan’ are arguments. tmux distinguishes between command parsing and execution.\tIn order to execute a command, tmux needs it to be split up into its name and arguments.  This is command parsing.  If a command is run from the shell, the shell parses it; from inside tmux or from a configuration file, tmux does.  Examples of when tmux parses commands are: -   in a configuration file; -   typed at the command prompt (see command-prompt); -   given to bind-key; -   passed as arguments to if-shell or confirm-before. To execute commands, each client has a ‘command queue’.  A global command queue not attached to any client is used on startup for configuration files like ~/.tmux.conf.  Parsed commands added to the queue are executed in order.\tSome commands, like if-shell and confirm-before, parse their argument to create a new command which is inserted immediately after themselves.  This means that arguments can be parsed twice or more - once when the parent command (such as if-shell) is parsed and again when it parses and executes its command.  Commands like if-shell, run-shell and display-panes stop execution of subsequent commands on the queue until something happens - if-shell and run-shell until a shell command finishes and display-panes until a key is pressed.\tFor example, the following commands: new-session; new-window if-shell \"true\" \"split-window\" kill-session Will execute new-session, new-window, if-shell, the shell command true(1), split-window and kill-session in that order. The COMMANDS section lists the tmux commands and their arguments. PARSING SYNTAX This section describes the syntax of commands parsed by tmux, for example in a configuration file or at the command prompt.\tNote that when commands are entered into the shell, they are parsed by the shell - see for example ksh(1) or csh(1). Each command is terminated by a newline or a semicolon (;).  Commands separated by semicolons together form a ‘command sequence’ - if a command in the sequence encounters an error, no subsequent commands are executed. It is recommended that a semicolon used as a command separator should be written as an individual token, for example from sh(1): $ tmux neww \\; splitw Or: $ tmux neww ';' splitw Or from the tmux command prompt: neww ; splitw However, a trailing semicolon is also interpreted as a command separator, for example in these sh(1) commands: $ tmux neww\\; splitw Or: $ tmux 'neww;' splitw As in these examples, when running tmux from the shell extra care must be taken to properly quote semicolons: 1.\tSemicolons that should be interpreted as a command separator should be escaped according to the shell conventions.  For sh(1) this typically means quoted (such as ‘neww ';' splitw’) or escaped (such as ‘neww \\\\\\\\; splitw’). 2.\tIndividual semicolons or trailing semicolons that should be interpreted as arguments should be escaped twice: once according to the shell conventions and a second time for tmux; for example: $ tmux neww 'foo\\\\;' bar $ tmux neww foo\\\\\\\\; bar 3.\tSemicolons that are not individual tokens or trailing another token should only be escaped once according to shell conventions; for example: $ tmux neww 'foo-;-bar' $ tmux neww foo-\\\\;-bar Comments are marked by the unquoted # character - any remaining text after a comment is ignored until the end of the line. If the last character of a line is \\, the line is joined with the following line (the \\ and the newline are completely removed).  This is called line continuation and applies both inside and outside quoted strings and in comments, but not inside braces. Command arguments may be specified as strings surrounded by single (') quotes, double quotes (\") or braces ({}).\tThis is required when the argument contains any special character.  Single and double quoted strings cannot span multiple lines except with line continuation.\tBraces can span multiple lines. Outside of quotes and inside double quotes, these replacements are performed: -   Environment variables preceded by $ are replaced with their value from the global environment (see the GLOBAL AND SESSION ENVIRONMENT section). -   A leading ~ or ~user is expanded to the home directory of the current or specified user. -   \\uXXXX or \\uXXXXXXXX is replaced by the Unicode codepoint corresponding to the given four or eight digit hexadecimal number. -   When preceded (escaped) by a \\, the following characters are replaced: \\e by the escape character; \\r by a carriage return; \\n by a newline; and \\t by a tab. -   \\ooo is replaced by a character of the octal value ooo.\tThree octal digits are required, for example \\001.  The largest valid character is \\377. -   Any other characters preceded by \\ are replaced by themselves (that is, the \\ is removed) and are not treated as having any special meaning - so for example \\; will not mark a command sequence and \\$ will not expand an environment variable. Braces are parsed as a configuration file (so conditions such as ‘%if’ are processed) and then converted into a string.  They are designed to avoid the need for additional escaping when passing a group of tmux commands as an argument (for example to if-shell).  These two examples produce an identical command - note that no escaping is needed when using {}: if-shell true { display -p 'brace-dollar-foo: }$foo' } if-shell true \"display -p 'brace-dollar-foo: }\\$foo'\" Braces may be enclosed inside braces, for example: bind x if-shell \"true\" { if-shell \"true\" { display \"true!\" } } Environment variables may be set by using the syntax ‘name=value’, for example ‘HOME=/home/user’.  Variables set during parsing are added to the global environment.  A hidden variable may be set with ‘%hidden’, for example: %hidden MYVAR=42 Hidden variables are not passed to the environment of processes created by tmux.  See the GLOBAL AND SESSION ENVIRONMENT section. Commands may be parsed conditionally by surrounding them with ‘%if’, ‘%elif’, ‘%else’ and ‘%endif’.  The argument to ‘%if’ and ‘%elif’ is expanded as a format (see FORMATS) and if it evaluates to false (zero or empty), subsequent text is ignored until the closing ‘%elif’, ‘%else’ or ‘%endif’.\tFor example: %if \"#{==:#{host},myhost}\" set -g status-style bg=red %elif \"#{==:#{host},myotherhost}\" set -g status-style bg=green %else set -g status-style bg=blue %endif Will change the status line to red if running on ‘myhost’, green if running on ‘myotherhost’, or blue if running on another host. Conditionals may be given on one line, for example: %if #{==:#{host},myhost} set -g status-style bg=red %endif"

God only knows what's going on with 12. The silent gateway 12 in the above may be the result of a bug in the 4.[23] BSD network code (and its derivatives):  4.x (x <= 3) sends an unreachable message using whatever ttl remains in the original datagram. Since, for gateways, the remaining ttl is zero, the ICMP \"time exceeded\" is guaranteed to not make it back to us.

Notice that there are 12 \"gateways\" (13 is the final destination) and exactly the last half of them are \"missing\".  What's really happening is that rip (a Sun-3 running Sun OS3.5) is using the ttl from our arriving datagram as the ttl in its ICMP reply.  So, the reply will time out on the return path (with no notice sent to anyone since ICMP's aren't sent for ICMP's) until we probe with a ttl that's at least twice the path length.  I.e., rip is really only 7 hops away.  A reply that returns with a ttl of 1 is a clue this problem exists.\ttraceroute prints a \"!\" after the time if the ttl is <= 1.  Since vendors ship a lot of obsolete (DEC´s Ultrix, Sun 3.x) or non-standard (HPUX) software, expect to see this problem frequently and/or take care picking the target host of your probes. Other possible annotations after the time are !H, !N, or !P (host, network or protocol unreachable), !S (source route failed), (fragmentation needed - the RFC1191 Path MTU Discovery value is displayed), !U or !W (destination network/host unknown), !I (source host is isolated), !A (communication with destination network administratively prohibited), !Z (communication with destination host administratively prohibited), !Q (for this ToS the destination network is unreachable), !T (for this ToS the destination host is unreachable), !X (communication administratively prohibited), !V (host precedence violation), !C (precedence cutoff in effect), or !<num> (ICMP unreachable code <num>). These are defined by RFC1812 (which supersedes RFC1716).  If almost all the probes result in some kind of unreachable, traceroute will give up and exit. This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement and management.  It should be used primarily for manual fault isolation. Because of the load it could impose on the network, it is unwise to use traceroute during normal operations or from automated scripts."

Common substrings in the file are first replaced by 9-bit codes 257 and up. When code 512 is reached, the algorithm switches to 10-bit codes and continues to use more bits until the limit specified by the -b option or its default is reached. After the limit is reached, compress periodically checks the compression ratio.  If it is increasing, compress continues to use the existing code dictionary.  However, if the compression ratio decreases, compress discards the table of substrings and rebuilds it from scratch.  This allows the algorithm to adapt to the next \"block\" of the file. The -b option is unavailable for uncompress since the bits parameter specified during compression is encoded within the output, along with a magic number to ensure that neither decompression of random data nor recompression of compressed data is attempted. The amount of compression obtained depends on the size of the input, the number of bits per code, and the distribution of common substrings. Typically, text such as source code or English is reduced by 50-60%. Compression is generally much better than that achieved by Huffman coding (as used in the historical command pack), or adaptive Huffman coding (as used in the historical command compact), and takes less time to compute. If file is a soft or hard link compress will replace it with a compressed copy of the file pointed to by the link.  The link's target file is left uncompressed. EXIT STATUS The compress and uncompress utilities exit 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs. The compress utility exits 2 if attempting to compress a file would not reduce its size and the -f option was not specified and if no other error occurs."

view gvim gview evim eview rvim rview rgvim rgview vim improved programmer s text editor upwards compatible -c command command will be executed after the first file has been read command is interpreted as an ex command if the command contains spaces it must be enclosed in double quotes this depends on the shell that is used example vim set si main c note you can use up to 10 or -c commands -a if vim has been compiled with arabic support for editing right-to-left oriented files and arabic keyboard mapping this option starts vim in arabic mode i e arabic is set otherwise an error message is given and vim aborts -b binary mode a few options will be set that makes it possible to edit a binary or executable file -c compatible set the compatible option this will make vim behave mostly like vi even though a vimrc file exists -d start in diff mode there should between two to eight file name arguments vim will open all the files and show differences between them works like vimdiff 1 -d device -dev device open device for use as a terminal only on the amiga example -d con 20 30 600 150 -d debugging go to debugging mode when executing the first command from a script -e start vim in ex mode just like the executable was called ex -e start vim in improved ex mode just like the executable was called exim -f foreground for the gui version vim will not fork and detach from the shell it was started in on the amiga vim is not restarted to open a new window this option should be used when vim is executed by a program that will wait for the edit session to finish e g mail on the amiga the sh and commands will not work -f if vim has been compiled with fkmap support for editing right-to-left oriented files and farsi keyboard mapping this option starts vim in farsi mode i e fkmap and rightleft are set otherwise an error message is given and vim aborts note farsi support has been removed in patch 8 1 0932 -g if vim has been compiled with gui support this option enables the gui if no gui support was compiled in an error message is given and vim aborts -h if vim has been compiled with rightleft support for editing right-to-left oriented files and hebrew keyboard mapping this option starts vim in hebrew mode i e hkmap and rightleft are set otherwise an error message is given and vim aborts -i viminfo specifies the filename to use when reading or writing the viminfo file instead of the default viminfo this can also be used to skip the use of the viminfo file by giving the name none -l lisp mode sets the lisp and showmatch options on -l same as -r -m modifying files is disabled resets the write option you can still modify the buffer but writing a file is not possible -m modifications not allowed the modifiable and write options will be unset so that changes are not allowed and files can not be written note that these options can be set to enable making modifications -n no swap file will be used recovery after a crash will be impossible handy if you want to edit a file on a very slow medium e g floppy can also be done with set uc 0 can be undone with set uc 200 -n no-compatible mode resets the compatible option this will make vim behave a bit better but less vi compatible even though a vimrc file does not exist -nb become an editor server for netbeans see the docs for details -o open n windows stacked when n is omitted open one window for each file -o open n windows side by side when n is omitted open one window for each file -p open n tab pages when n is omitted open one tab page for each file -p parent-title win32 gui only specify the title of the parent application when possible vim will run in an mdi window inside the application parent-title must appear in the window title of the parent application make sure that it is specific enough note that the implementation is still primitive it won t work with all applications and the menu doesn t work -r list swap files with information about using them for recovery -r file recovery mode the swap file is used to recover a crashed editing session the swap file is a file with the same filename as the text file with swp appended see help recovery -r read-only mode the readonly option will be set you can still edit the buffer but will be prevented from accidentally overwriting a file if you do want to overwrite a file add an exclamation mark to the ex command as in w the -r option also implies the -n option see above the readonly option can be reset with set noro see help readonly -s silent mode only when started as ex or when the -e option was given before the -s option -s scriptin the script file scriptin is read the characters in the file are interpreted as if you had typed them the same can be done with the command source scriptin if the end of the file is reached before the editor exits further characters are read from the keyboard -s file file will be sourced after the first file has been read this is equivalent to -c source file file cannot start with - if file is omitted session vim is used only works when -s is the last argument -t terminal tells vim the name of the terminal you are using only required when the automatic way doesn t work should be a terminal known to vim builtin or defined in the termcap or terminfo file -u vimrc use the commands in the file vimrc for initializations all the other initializations are skipped use this to edit a special kind of files it can also be used to skip all initializations by giving the name none see help initialization within vim for more details -u gvimrc use the commands in the file gvimrc for gui initializations all the other gui initializations are skipped it can also be used to skip all gui initializations by giving the name none see help gui-init within vim for more details -v start vim in vi mode just like the executable was called vi this only has effect when the executable is called ex -v verbose give messages about which files are sourced and for reading and writing a viminfo file the optional number n is the value for verbose default is 10 -v filename like -v and set verbosefile to filename the result is that messages are not displayed but written to the file filename filename must not start with a digit -w number set the window option to number -w scriptout all the characters that you type are recorded in the file scriptout until you exit vim this is useful if you want to create a script file to be used with vim -s or source if the scriptout file exists characters are appended -w scriptout like -w but an existing file is overwritten -x if vim has been compiled with encryption support use encryption when writing files will prompt for a crypt key -x don t connect to the x server shortens startup time in a terminal but the window title and clipboard will not be used -y start vim in easy mode just like the executable was called evim or eview makes vim behave like a click-and-type editor --clean do not use any personal configuration vimrc plugins etc useful to see if a problem reproduces with a clean vim setup --cmd command like using -c but the command is executed just before processing any vimrc file you can use up to 10 of these commands independently from -c commands --echo-wid gtk gui only echo the window id on stdout --gui-dialog-file name when using the gui instead of showing a dialog write the title and message of the dialog to file name the file is created or appended to only useful for testing to avoid that the test gets stuck on a dialog that can t be seen without the gui the argument is ignored --help -h - give a bit of help about the command line arguments and options after this vim exits --literal take file name arguments literally do not expand wildcards this has no effect on unix where the shell expands wildcards --log filename if vim has been compiled with eval and channel feature start logging and write entries to filename this works like calling ch logfile filename ao very early during startup --nofork foreground for the gui version vim will not fork and detach from the shell it was started in --noplugin skip loading plugins implied by -u none --not-a-term tells vim that the user knows that the input and or output is not connected to a terminal this will avoid the warning and the two second delay that would happen --remote connect to a vim server and make it edit the files given in the rest of the arguments if no server is found a warning is given and the files are edited in the current vim --remote-expr expr connect to a vim server evaluate expr in it and print the result on stdout --remote-send keys connect to a vim server and send keys to it --remote-silent as --remote but without the warning when no server is found --remote-wait as --remote but vim does not exit until the files have been edited --remote-wait-silent as --remote-wait but without the warning when no server is found --serverlist list the names of all vim servers that can be found --servername name use name as the server name used for the current vim unless used with a --remote argument then it s the name of the server to connect to --socketid id gtk gui only use the gtkplug mechanism to run gvim in another window --startuptime file during startup write timing messages to the file fname --ttyfail when stdin or stdout is not a a terminal tty then exit right away --version print version information and exit --windowid id win32 gui only make gvim try to use the window id as a parent so that it runs inside that window on-line help type help in vim to get started type help subject to get help on a specific subject for example help zz to get help for the zz command use tab and ctrl-d to complete subjects help cmdline-completion tags are present to jump from one place to another sort of hypertext links see help all documentation files can be viewed in this way for example help syntax txt name like the above but with restrictions it will not be possible to start shell commands or suspend vim can also be done with the -z argument options",

logfile does not exist a new file is created --debug turn on debug output meaning various information important to the developers of wget if it does not work properly your system administrator may have chosen to compile wget without debug support in which case -d will not work please note that compiling with debug support is always safe---wget compiled with the debug support will not print any debug info unless requested with -d --quiet turn off wget s output --verbose turn on verbose output with all the available data the default output is verbose --no-verbose turn off verbose without

file read urls from a local or external file if - is specified as file urls are read from the standard input use - to read from a file literally named - if this function is used no urls need be present on the command line if there are urls both on the command line and in an input file those on the command lines will be the first ones to be retrieved if --force-html is not specified then file should consist of a series of urls one per line however if you specify --force-html the document will be regarded as html in that case you may have problems with relative links which you can solve either by adding base href url to the documents or by specifying --base url on the command line if the file is an external one the document will be automatically treated as html if the content-type matches text html furthermore the file s location will be implicitly used as base href if none was specified if the file is a local file on systems that support it it will be opened with the o nonblock flag to allow non-blocking reads from the file wget will attempt to continue reading from the file until eof is reached or it is closed this allows one to stream a list of files for retrieval where the list is dynamically generated during the execution of the process currently this feature is not available on windows platforms --input-metalink file downloads files covered in local metalink

may have been sorted by priority key s value keep this in mind to choose the right number --preferred-location set preferred location for metalink resources this has effect if multiple resources with same priority are available --xattr enable use of file system s extended attributes to save the original url and the referer http header value if used be aware that the url might contain private information like access tokens or credentials --force-html when input is read from a file force it to be treated as an html file this enables you to retrieve relative links from existing html files on your local disk by adding base href url to html or using the --base command-line option --base url resolves relative links using url as the point of reference when reading links from an html file specified via the -i --input-file option together with --force-html or when the input file was fetched remotely from a server describing it as html this is equivalent to the presence of a base tag in the html input file with url as the value for the href attribute for instance if you specify http foo bar a html for url and wget reads baz b html from the input file it would be resolved to http foo baz b html --config file specify the location of a startup file you wish to use instead of the default one s use --no-config to disable reading of config files if both --config and --no-config are given --no-config is ignored --rejected-log logfile logs all url rejections to logfile as comma separated values the values include the reason of rejection the url and the parent url it was found in

your machine is bound to multiple ips --bind-dns-address address libcares only this address overrides the route for dns requests if you ever need to circumvent the standard settings from etc resolv conf this option together with --dns-servers is your friend address must be specified either as ipv4 or ipv6 address wget needs to be built with libcares for this option to be available --dns-servers addresses libcares only the given address es override the standard nameserver addresses e g as configured in etc resolv conf addresses may be specified either as ipv4 or ipv6 addresses comma-

concatenated together and written to file if - is used as file documents will be printed to standard output disabling link conversion use - to print to a file literally named - use of -o is not intended to mean simply use the name file instead of the one in the url rather it is analogous to shell redirection wget -o file http foo is intended to work like wget -o - http foo file file will be truncated immediately and all downloaded content will be written there for this reason -n for timestamp-checking is not supported in combination with -o since file is always newly created it will always have a very new timestamp a warning will be issued if this combination is used similarly using -r or -p with -o may not work as you expect wget won t just download the first file to file and then download the rest to their normal names all downloaded content will be placed in file this was disabled in version 1 11 but has been reinstated with a warning in 1 11 2 as there are some cases where this behavior can actually have some use a combination with -nc is only accepted if the given output file does not exist note that a combination with -k is only permitted when downloading a single document as in that case it will just convert all relative uris to external ones -k makes no sense for multiple uris when they re all being downloaded to a single file -k can be used only when the output is a regular file --no-clobber if a file is downloaded more than once in the same directory wget s behavior depends on a few options including -nc in certain cases the local file will be clobbered or overwritten upon repeated download in other cases it will be preserved when running wget without -n -nc -r or -p downloading the same file in the same directory will result in the original copy of file being preserved and the second copy being named file 1 if that file is downloaded yet again the third copy will be named file 2 and so on this is also the behavior with -nd even if -r or -p are in effect when -nc is specified this behavior is suppressed and wget will refuse to download newer copies of file therefore no-clobber is actually a misnomer in this mode---it s not clobbering that s prevented as the numeric suffixes were already preventing clobbering but rather the multiple version saving that s prevented when running wget with -r or -p but without -n -nd or -nc re- downloading a file will result in the new copy simply overwriting the old adding -nc will prevent this behavior instead causing the original version to be preserved and any newer copies on the server to be ignored when running wget with -n with or without -r or -p the decision as to whether or not to download a newer copy of a file depends on the local and remote timestamp and size of the file -nc may not be specified at the same time as -n a combination with -o --output-document is only accepted if the given output file does not exist note that when -nc is specified files with the suffixes html or htm will be loaded from the local disk and parsed as if they had been retrieved from the web --backups backups before over writing a file back up an existing file by adding a 1 suffix 1 on vms to the file name such backup files are rotated to 2 3 and so on up to backups and lost beyond that --no-netrc do not try to obtain credentials from netrc file by default netrc file is searched for credentials in case none have been passed on command line and authentication is required --continue continue getting a partially-downloaded file this is useful when you want to finish up a download started by a previous instance of wget or by another program for instance wget -c ftp sunsite doc ic ac uk ls-lr z if there is a file named ls-lr z in the current directory wget will assume that it is the first portion of the remote file and will ask the server to continue the retrieval from an offset equal to the length of the local file note that you don t need to specify this option if you just want the current invocation of wget to retry downloading a file should the connection be lost midway through this is the default behavior -c only affects resumption of downloads started prior to this invocation of wget and whose local files are still sitting around without -c the previous example would just download the remote file to ls-lr z 1 leaving the truncated ls-lr z file alone if you use -c on a non-empty file and the server does not support continued downloading wget will restart the download from scratch and overwrite the existing file entirely beginning with wget 1 7 if you use -c on a file which is of equal size as the one on the server wget will refuse to download the file and print an explanatory message the same happens when the file is smaller on the server than locally presumably because it was changed on the server since your last download attempt ---because continuing is not meaningful no download occurs on the other side of the coin while using -c any file that s bigger on the server than locally will be considered an incomplete download and only length remote - length local bytes will be downloaded and tacked onto the end of the local file this behavior can be desirable in certain cases---for instance you can use wget -c to download just the new portion that s been appended to a data collection or log file however if the file is bigger on the server because it s been changed as opposed to just appended to you ll end up with a garbled file wget has no way of verifying that the local file is really a valid prefix of the remote file you need to be especially careful of this when using -c in conjunction with -r since every file will be considered as an incomplete download candidate another instance where you ll get a garbled file if you try to use --start-pos offset start downloading at zero-based position offset offset may be expressed in bytes kilobytes with the k suffix or megabytes with the m suffix etc --start-pos has higher precedence over --continue when --start-pos and --continue are both specified wget will emit a warning then proceed as if --continue was absent server support for continued download is required otherwise --start-pos cannot help see -c for details --progress type select the type of the progress indicator you wish to use legal indicators are dot and bar the bar indicator is used by default it draws an ascii progress bar graphics a k a thermometer display indicating the status of retrieval if the output is not a tty the dot bar will be used by default use --progress dot to switch to the dot display it traces the retrieval by printing dots on the screen each dot representing a fixed amount of downloaded data the progress type can also take one or more parameters the parameters vary based on the type selected parameters to type are passed by appending them to the type sperated by a colon like this --progress type parameter1 parameter2 when using the dotted retrieval you may set the style by specifying the type as dot style different styles assign different meaning to one dot with the default style each dot represents 1k there are ten dots in a cluster and 50 dots in a line the binary style has a more computer -like orientation---8k dots 16-dots clusters and 48 dots per line which makes for 384k lines the mega style is suitable for downloading large files---each dot represents 64k retrieved there are eight dots in a cluster and 48 dots on each line so each line contains 3m if mega is not enough then you can use the giga style---each dot represents 1m retrieved there are eight dots in a cluster and 32 dots on each line so each line contains 32m with --progress bar there are currently two possible parameters force and noscroll when the output is not a tty the progress bar always falls back to dot even if --progress bar was passed to wget during invocation this behaviour can be overridden and the bar output forced by using the force parameter as --progress bar force by default the bar style progress bar scroll the name of the file from left to right for the file being downloaded if the filename exceeds the maximum length allotted for its display in certain cases such as with --progress bar force one may not want the scrolling filename in the progress bar by passing the noscroll parameter wget can be forced to display as much of the filename as possible without scrolling through it note that you can set the default style using the progress command in wgetrc that setting may be overridden from the command line for example to force the bar output without scrolling use --progress bar force noscroll --show-progress force wget to display the progress bar in any verbosity by default wget only displays the progress bar in verbose mode one may however want wget to display the progress bar on screen in conjunction with any other verbosity modes like --no-verbose or --quiet this is often a desired a property when invoking wget to download several small large files in such a case wget could simply be invoked with this parameter to get a much cleaner output on the screen this option will also force the progress bar to be printed to stderr when used alongside the --output-file option --timestamping turn on time-stamping --no-if-modified-since do not send if-modified-since header in -n mode send preliminary head request instead this has only effect in -n mode --no-use-server-timestamps don t set the local file s timestamp by the one on the server by default when a file is downloaded its timestamps are set to match those from the remote file this allows the use of --timestamping on subsequent invocations of wget however it is sometimes useful to base the local file s timestamp on when it was actually downloaded for that purpose the --no-use-server-timestamps option has been provided --server-response print the headers sent by http servers and responses sent by ftp servers --spider when invoked with this option wget will behave as a web spider which means that it will not download the pages just check that they are there for example you can use wget to check your bookmarks wget --spider --force-html -i bookmarks html this feature needs much more work for wget to get close to the functionality of real web spiders --timeout seconds set the network timeout to seconds seconds this is equivalent to specifying --dns-timeout --connect-timeout and --read-timeout all at the same time when interacting with the network wget can check for timeout and abort the operation if it takes too long this prevents anomalies like hanging reads and infinite connects the only timeout enabled by default is a 900-second read timeout setting a timeout to 0 disables it altogether unless you know what you are doing it is best not to change the default timeout settings all timeout-related options accept decimal values as well as subsecond values for example 0 1 seconds is a legal though unwise choice of timeout subsecond timeouts are useful for checking server response times or for testing network latency --dns-timeout seconds set the dns lookup timeout to seconds seconds dns lookups that don t complete within the specified time will fail by default there is no timeout on dns lookups other than that implemented by system libraries --connect-timeout seconds set the connect timeout to seconds seconds tcp connections that take longer to establish will be aborted by default there is no connect timeout other than that implemented by system libraries --read-timeout seconds set the read and write timeout to seconds seconds the time of this timeout refers to idle time if at any point in the download no data is received for more than the specified number of seconds reading fails and the download is restarted this option does not directly affect the duration of the entire download of course the remote server may choose to terminate the connection sooner than this option requires the default read timeout is 900 seconds --limit-rate amount limit the download speed to amount bytes per second amount may be expressed in bytes kilobytes with the k suffix or megabytes with the m suffix for example --limit-rate 20k will limit the retrieval rate to 20kb s this is useful when for whatever reason you don t want wget to consume the entire available bandwidth this option allows the use of decimal numbers usually in conjunction with power suffixes for example --limit-rate 2 5k is a legal value note that wget implements the limiting by sleeping the appropriate amount of time after a network read that took less time than specified by the rate eventually this strategy causes the tcp transfer to slow down to approximately the specified rate however it may take some time for this balance to be achieved so don t be surprised if limiting the rate doesn t work well with very small files --wait seconds wait the specified number of seconds between the retrievals use of this option is recommended as it lightens the server load by making the requests less frequent instead of in seconds the time can be specified in minutes using the m suffix in hours using h suffix or in days using d suffix specifying a large value for this option is useful if the network or the destination host is down so that wget can wait long enough to reasonably expect the network error to be fixed before the retry the waiting interval specified by this function is influenced by --random-wait which see --waitretry seconds if you don t want wget to wait between every retrieval but only between retries of failed downloads you can use this option wget will use linear backoff waiting 1 second after the first failure on a given file then waiting 2 seconds after the second failure on that file up to the maximum number of seconds you specify by default wget will assume a value of 10 seconds --random-wait some web sites may perform log analysis to identify retrieval programs such as wget by looking for statistically significant similarities in the time between requests this option causes the time between requests to vary between 0 5 and 1 5 wait seconds where wait was specified using the --wait option in order to mask wget s presence from such analysis a 2001 article in a publication devoted to development on a popular consumer platform provided code to perform this analysis on the fly its author suggested blocking at the class c address level to ensure automated retrieval programs were blocked despite changing dhcp-supplied addresses the --random-wait option was inspired by this ill-advised recommendation to block many unrelated users from a web site due to the actions of one --no-proxy don t use proxies even if the appropriate proxy environment variable is defined --quota quota specify download quota for automatic retrievals the value can be specified in bytes default kilobytes with k suffix or megabytes with m suffix note that quota will never affect downloading a single file so if you specify wget -q10k https example com ls-lr gz all of the ls-lr gz will be downloaded the same goes even when several urls are specified on the command-line the quota is checked only at the end of each downloaded file so it will never result in a partially downloaded file thus you may safely type wget -q2m -i sites---download will be aborted after the file that exhausts the quota is completely downloaded setting quota to 0 or to inf unlimits the download quota --no-dns-cache turn off caching of dns lookups normally wget remembers the ip addresses it looked up from dns so it doesn t have to repeatedly contact the dns server for the same typically small set of hosts it retrieves from this cache exists in memory only a new wget run will contact dns again however it has been reported that in some situations it is not desirable to cache host names even for the duration of a short- running application like wget with this option wget issues a new dns lookup more precisely a new call to gethostbyname or getaddrinfo each time it makes a new connection please note that this option will not affect caching that might be performed by the resolving library or by an external caching layer such as nscd if you don t understand exactly what this option does you probably won t need it --restrict-file-names modes change which characters found in remote urls must be escaped during generation of local filenames characters that are restricted by this option are escaped i e replaced with hh where hh is the hexadecimal number that corresponds to the restricted character this option may also be used to force all alphabetical cases to be either lower- or uppercase by default wget escapes the characters that are not valid or safe as part of file names on your operating system as well as control characters that are typically unprintable this option is useful for changing these defaults perhaps because you are downloading to a non-native partition or because you want to disable escaping of the control characters or you want to further restrict characters to only those in the ascii range of values the modes are a comma-separated set of text values the acceptable values are unix windows nocontrol ascii lowercase and uppercase the values unix and windows are mutually exclusive one will override the other as are lowercase and uppercase those last are special cases as they do not change the set of characters that would be escaped but rather force local file paths to be converted either to lower- or uppercase when unix is specified wget escapes the character and the control characters in the ranges 0--31 and 128--159 this is the default on unix-like operating systems when windows is given wget escapes the characters and the control characters in the ranges 0--31 and 128--159 in addition to this wget in windows mode uses instead of to separate host and port in local file names and uses instead of to separate the query portion of the file name from the rest therefore a url that would be saved as www xemacs org 4300 search pl input blah in unix mode would be saved as www xemacs org 4300 search pl input blah in windows mode this mode is the default on windows if you specify nocontrol then the escaping of the control characters is also switched off this option may make sense when you are downloading urls whose names contain utf-8 characters on a system which can save and display filenames in utf-8 some possible byte values used in utf-8 byte sequences fall in the range of values designated by wget as controls the ascii mode is used to specify that any bytes whose values are outside the range of ascii characters that is greater than 127 shall be escaped this can be useful when saving filenames whose encoding does not match the one used locally --inet4-only --inet6-only force connecting to ipv4 or ipv6 addresses with --inet4-only or --prefer-family none ipv4 ipv6 when given a choice of several addresses connect to the addresses with specified address family first the address order returned by dns is used without change by default this avoids spurious errors and connect attempts when accessing hosts that resolve to both ipv6 and ipv4 addresses from ipv4 networks for example www kame net resolves to 2001 200 0 8002 203 47ff fea5 3085 and to 203 178 141 194 when the preferred family is ipv4 the ipv4 address is used first when the preferred family is ipv6 the ipv6 address is used first if the specified value is none the address order returned by dns is used without change unlike -4 and -6 this option doesn t inhibit access to any address family it only changes the order in which the addresses are accessed also note that the reordering performed by this option is stable---it doesn t affect order of addresses of the same family that is the relative order of all ipv4 addresses and of all ipv6 addresses remains intact in all cases --retry-connrefused consider connection refused a transient error and try again normally wget gives up on a url when it is unable to connect to the site because failure to connect is taken as a sign that the server is not running at all and that retries would not help this option is for mirroring unreliable sites whose servers tend to disappear for short periods of time --user user --password password specify the username user and password password for both ftp and http file retrieval these parameters can be overridden using the --ftp-user and --ftp-password options for ftp connections and the --http-user and --http-password options for http connections --ask-password prompt for a password for each connection established cannot be specified when --password is being used because they are mutually exclusive --use-askpass command prompt for a user and password using the specified command if no command is specified then the command in the environment variable wget askpass is used if wget askpass is not set then the command in the environment variable ssh askpass is used you can set the default command for use-askpass in the wgetrc that setting may be overridden from the command line --no-iri turn off internationalized uri iri support use --iri to turn it on iri support is activated by default you can set the default state of iri support using the iri command in wgetrc that setting may be overridden from the command line --local-encoding encoding force wget to use encoding as the default system encoding that affects how wget converts urls specified as arguments from locale to utf-8 for iri support wget use the function nl langinfo and then the charset environment variable to get the locale if it fails ascii is used you can set the default local encoding using the local encoding command in wgetrc that setting may be overridden from the command line --remote-encoding encoding force wget to use encoding as the default remote server encoding that affects how wget converts uris found in files from remote encoding to utf-8 during a recursive fetch this options is only useful for iri support for the interpretation of non-ascii characters for http remote encoding can be found in http content-type header and in html content-type http-equiv meta tag you can set the default encoding using the remoteencoding command in wgetrc that setting may be overridden from the command line --unlink force wget to unlink file instead of clobbering existing file this option is useful for downloading to the directory with hardlinks directory options --no-directories do not create a hierarchy of directories when retrieving recursively with this option turned on all files will get saved to the current directory without clobbering if a name shows up more than once the filenames will get extensions n --force-directories the opposite of -nd---create a hierarchy of directories even if one would not have been created otherwise e g wget -x http fly srk fer hr robots txt will save the downloaded file to fly srk fer hr robots txt --no-host-directories disable generation of host-prefixed directories by default invoking wget with -r http fly srk fer hr will create a structure of directories beginning with fly srk fer hr this option disables such behavior --protocol-directories use the protocol name as a directory component of local file names for example with this option wget -r http host will save to http host rather than just to host --cut-dirs number ignore number directory components this is useful for getting a fine-grained control over the directory where recursive retrieval will be saved take for example the directory at ftp ftp xemacs org pub xemacs if you retrieve it with -r it will be saved locally under ftp xemacs org pub xemacs while the -nh option can remove the ftp xemacs org part you are still stuck with pub xemacs this is where --cut-dirs comes in handy it makes wget not see number remote directory components here are several examples of how --cut-dirs option works no options - ftp xemacs org pub xemacs -nh - pub xemacs -nh --cut-dirs 1 - xemacs --cut-dirs 1 - ftp xemacs org xemacs if you just want to get rid of the directory structure this option is similar to a combination of -nd and -p however unlike -nd --cut-dirs does not lose with subdirectories---for instance with -nh --cut-dirs 1 a beta subdirectory will be placed to xemacs beta as one would expect --directory-prefix prefix set directory prefix to prefix the directory prefix is the directory where all other files and subdirectories will be saved to i e the top of the retrieval tree the default is the current directory http options --default-page name use name as the default file name when it isn t known i e for urls that end in a slash instead of index html --adjust-extension if a file of type application xhtml xml or text html is downloaded and the url does not end with the regexp hh tt mm ll this option will cause the suffix html to be appended to the local filename this is useful for instance when you re mirroring a remote site that uses asp pages but you want the mirrored pages to be viewable on your stock apache server another good use for this is when you re downloading cgi-generated materials a url like http site com article cgi 25 will be saved as article cgi 25 html note that filenames changed in this way will be re-downloaded every time you re-mirror a site because wget can t tell that the local x html file corresponds to remote url x since it doesn t yet know that the url produces output of type text html or application xhtml xml as of version 1 12 wget will also ensure that any downloaded files of type text css end in the suffix css and the option was renamed from --html-extension to better reflect its new behavior the old option name is still acceptable but should now be considered deprecated as of version 1 19 2 wget will also ensure that any downloaded files with a content-encoding of br compress deflate or gzip end in the suffix br z zlib and gz respectively at some point in the future this option may well be expanded to include suffixes for other types of content including content types that are not parsed by wget --http-user user --http-password password specify the username user and password password on an http server according to the type of the challenge wget will encode them using either the basic insecure the digest or the windows ntlm authentication scheme another way to specify username and password is in the url itself either method reveals your password to anyone who bothers to run ps to prevent the passwords from being seen use the --use-askpass or store them in wgetrc or netrc and make sure to protect those files from other users with chmod if the passwords are really important do not leave them lying in those files either---edit the files and delete them after wget has started the download --no-http-keep-alive turn off the keep-alive feature for http downloads normally wget asks the server to keep the connection open so that when you download more than one document from the same server they get transferred over the same tcp connection this saves time and at the same time reduces the load on the server this option is useful when for some reason persistent keep- alive connections don t work for you for example due to a server bug or due to the inability of server-side scripts to cope with the connections --no-cache disable server-side cache in this case wget will send the remote server appropriate directives cache-control no-cache and pragma no-cache to get the file from the remote service rather than returning the cached version this is especially useful for retrieving and flushing out-of-date documents on proxy servers caching is allowed by default --no-cookies disable the use of cookies cookies are a mechanism for maintaining server-side state the server sends the client a cookie using the set-cookie header and the client responds with the same cookie upon further requests since cookies allow the server owners to keep track of visitors and for sites to exchange this information some consider them a breach of privacy the default is to use cookies however storing cookies is not on by default --load-cookies file load cookies from file before the first http retrieval file is a textual file in the format originally used by netscape s cookies txt file you will typically use this option when mirroring sites that require that you be logged in to access some or all of their content the login process typically works by the web server issuing an http cookie upon receiving and verifying your credentials the cookie is then resent by the browser when accessing that part of the site and so proves your identity mirroring such a site requires wget to send the same cookies your browser sends when communicating with the site this is achieved by --load-cookies---simply point wget to the location of the cookies txt file and it will send the same cookies your browser would send in the same situation different browsers keep textual cookie files in different locations netscape 4 x the cookies are in netscape cookies txt mozilla and netscape 6 x mozilla s cookie file is also named cookies txt located somewhere under mozilla in the directory of your profile the full path usually ends up looking somewhat like mozilla default some-weird-string cookies txt internet explorer you can produce a cookie file wget can use by using the file menu import and export export cookies this has been tested with internet explorer 5 it is not guaranteed to work with earlier versions other browsers if you are using a different browser to create your cookies --load-cookies will only work if you can locate or produce a cookie file in the netscape format that wget expects if you cannot use --load-cookies there might still be an alternative if your browser supports a cookie manager you can use it to view the cookies used when accessing the site you re mirroring write down the name and value of the cookie and manually instruct wget to send those cookies bypassing the official cookie support wget --no-cookies --header cookie name value --save-cookies file save cookies to file before exiting this will not save cookies that have expired or that have no expiry time so-called session cookies but also see --keep-session-cookies --keep-session-cookies when specified causes --save-cookies to also save session cookies session cookies are normally not saved because they are meant to be kept in memory and forgotten when you exit the browser saving them is useful on sites that require you to log in or to visit the home page before you can access some pages with this option multiple wget runs are considered a single browser session as far as the site is concerned since the cookie file format does not normally carry session cookies wget marks them with an expiry timestamp of 0 wget s --load-cookies recognizes those as session cookies but it might confuse other browsers also note that cookies so loaded will be treated as other session cookies which means that if you want --save-cookies to preserve them again you must use --keep-session-cookies again --ignore-length unfortunately some http servers cgi programs to be more precise send out bogus content-length headers which makes wget go wild as it thinks not all the document was retrieved you can spot this syndrome if wget retries getting the same document again and again each time claiming that the otherwise normal connection has closed on the very same byte with this option wget will ignore the content-length header---as if it never existed --header header-line send header-line along with the rest of the headers in each http request the supplied header is sent as-is which means it must contain name and value separated by colon and must not contain newlines you may define more than one additional header by specifying --header more than once wget --header accept-charset iso-8859-2 --header accept-language hr http fly srk fer hr specification of an empty string as the header value will clear all previous user-defined headers as of wget 1 10 this option can be used to override headers otherwise generated automatically this example instructs wget to connect to localhost but to specify foo bar in the host header wget --header host foo bar http localhost in versions of wget prior to 1 10 such use of --header caused sending of duplicate headers --compression type choose the type of compression to be used legal values are auto gzip and none if auto or gzip are specified wget asks the server to compress the file using the gzip compression format if the server compresses the file and responds with the content-encoding header field set appropriately the file will be decompressed automatically if none is specified wget will not ask the server to compress the file and will not decompress any server responses this is the default compression support is currently experimental in case it is turned on please report any bugs to bug-wget gnu org --max-redirect number specifies the maximum number of redirections to follow for a resource the default is 20 which is usually far more than necessary however on those occasions where you want to allow more or fewer this is the option to use --proxy-user user --proxy-password password specify the username user and password password for authentication on a proxy server wget will encode them using the basic authentication scheme security considerations similar to those with --http-password pertain here as well --referer url include referer url header in http request useful for retrieving documents with server-side processing that assume they are always being retrieved by interactive web browsers and only come out properly when referer is set to one of the pages that point to them --save-headers save the headers sent by the http server to the file preceding the actual contents with an empty line as the separator --user-agent agent-string identify as agent-string to the http server the http protocol allows the clients to identify themselves using a user-agent header field this enables distinguishing the www software usually for statistical purposes or for tracing of protocol violations wget normally identifies as wget version version being the current version number of wget however some sites have been known to impose the policy of tailoring the output according to the user-agent -supplied information while this is not such a bad idea in theory it has been abused by servers denying information to clients other than historically netscape or more frequently microsoft internet explorer this option allows you to change the user-agent line issued by wget use of this option is discouraged unless you really know what you are doing specifying empty user agent with --user-agent instructs wget not to send the user-agent header in http requests --post-data string --post-file file use post as the method for all http requests and send the specified data in the request body --post-data sends string as data whereas --post-file sends the contents of file other than that they work in exactly the same way in particular they both expect content of the form key1 value1 key2 value2 with percent- encoding for special characters the only difference is that one expects its content as a command-line parameter and the other accepts its content from a file in particular --post-file is not for transmitting files as form attachments those must appear as key value data with appropriate percent-coding just like everything else wget does not currently support multipart form-data for transmitting post data only application x-www-form-urlencoded only one of --post-data and --post-file should be specified please note that wget does not require the content to be of the form key1 value1 key2 value2 and neither does it test for it wget will simply transmit whatever data is provided to it most servers however expect the post data to be in the above format when processing html forms when sending a post request using the --post-file option wget treats the file as a binary file and will send every character in the post request without stripping trailing newline or formfeed characters any other control characters in the text will also be sent as-is in the post request please be aware that wget needs to know the size of the post data in advance therefore the argument to --post-file must be a regular file specifying a fifo or something like dev stdin won t work it s not quite clear how to work around this limitation inherent in http 1 0 although http 1 1 introduces chunked transfer that doesn t require knowing the request length in advance a client can t use chunked unless it knows it s talking to an http 1 1 server and it can t know that until it receives a response which in turn requires the request to have been completed -- a chicken-and-egg problem note as of version 1 15 if wget is redirected after the post request is completed its behaviour will depend on the response code returned by the server in case of a 301 moved permanently 302 moved temporarily or 307 temporary redirect wget will in accordance with rfc2616 continue to send a post request in case a server wants the client to change the request method upon redirection it should send a 303 see other response code this example shows how to log in to a server using post and then proceed to download the desired pages presumably only accessible to authorized users log in to the server this can be done only once wget --save-cookies cookies txt --post-data user foo password bar http example com auth php now grab the page or pages we care about wget --load-cookies cookies txt --save-cookies to force saving of session cookies --method http-method for the purpose of restful scripting wget allows sending of other http methods without the need to explicitly set them using --header header-line wget will use whatever string is passed to it after --method as the http method to the server --body-data data-string --body-file data-file must be set when additional data needs to be sent to the server along with the method specified using --method --body-data sends string as data whereas --body-file sends the contents of file other than that they work in exactly the same way currently --body-file is not for transmitting files as a whole wget does not currently support multipart form-data for transmitting data only application x-www-form-urlencoded in the future this may be changed so that wget sends the --body-file as a complete file instead of sending its contents to the server please be aware that wget needs to know the contents of body data in advance and hence the argument to --body-file should be a regular file see --post-file for a more detailed explanation only one of --body-data and --body-file should be specified if wget is redirected after the request is completed wget will suspend the current method and send a get request till the redirection is completed this is true for all redirection response codes except 307 temporary redirect which is used to explicitly specify that the request method should not change another exception is when the method is set to post in which case the redirection rules specified under --post-data are followed --content-disposition if this is set to on experimental not fully-functional support for content-disposition headers is enabled this can currently result in extra round-trips to the server for a head request and is known to suffer from a few bugs which is why it is not currently enabled by default this option is useful for some file-downloading cgi programs that use content-disposition headers to describe what the name of a downloaded file should be when combined with --metalink-over-http and --trust-server-names a content-type application metalink4 xml file is named using the content-disposition filename field if available --content-on-error if this is set to on wget will not skip the content when the server responds with a http status code that indicates error --trust-server-names if this is set on a redirect the local file name will be based on the redirection url by default the local file name is based on the original url when doing recursive retrieving this can be helpful because in many web sites redirected urls correspond to an underlying file structure while link urls do not --auth-no-challenge if this option is given wget will send basic http authentication information plaintext username and password for all requests just like wget 1 10 2 and prior did by default use of this option is not recommended and is intended only to support some few obscure servers which never send http authentication challenges but accept unsolicited auth info say in addition to form-based authentication --retry-on-host-error consider host errors such as temporary failure in name resolution as non-fatal transient errors --retry-on-http-error code code consider given http response codes as non-fatal transient errors supply a comma-separated list of 3-digit http response codes as argument useful to work around special circumstances where retries are required but the server responds with an error code normally not retried by wget such errors might be 503 service unavailable and 429 too many requests retries enabled by this option are performed subject to the normal retry timing and retry count limitations of wget using this option is intended to support special use cases only and is generally not recommended as it can force retries even in cases where the server is actually trying to decrease its load please use wisely and only if you know what you are doing https ssl tls options to support encrypted http https downloads wget must be compiled with an external ssl library the current default is gnutls in addition wget also supports hsts http strict transport security if wget is compiled without ssl support none of these options are available --secure-protocol protocol choose the secure protocol to be used legal values are auto sslv2 sslv3 tlsv1 tlsv1 1 tlsv1 2 tlsv1 3 and pfs if auto is used the ssl library is given the liberty of choosing the appropriate protocol automatically which is achieved by sending a tlsv1 greeting this is the default specifying sslv2 sslv3 tlsv1 tlsv1 1 tlsv1 2 or tlsv1 3 forces the use of the corresponding protocol this is useful when talking to old and buggy ssl server implementations that make it hard for the underlying ssl library to choose the correct protocol version fortunately such servers are quite rare specifying pfs enforces the use of the so-called perfect forward security cipher suites in short pfs adds security by creating a one-time key for each ssl connection it has a bit more cpu impact on client and server we use known to be secure ciphers e g no md4 and the tls protocol this mode also explicitly excludes non- pfs key exchange methods such as rsa --https-only when in recursive mode only https links are followed --ciphers set the cipher list string typically this string sets the cipher suites and other ssl tls options that the user wish should be used in a set order of preference gnutls calls it priority string this string will be fed verbatim to the ssl tls engine openssl or gnutls and hence its format and syntax is dependent on that wget will not process or manipulate it in any way refer to the openssl or gnutls documentation for more information --no-check-certificate don t check the server certificate against the available certificate authorities also don t require the url host name to match the common name presented by the certificate as of wget 1 10 the default is to verify the server s certificate against the recognized certificate authorities breaking the ssl handshake and aborting the download if the verification fails although this provides more secure downloads it does break interoperability with some sites that worked with previous wget versions particularly those using self-signed expired or otherwise invalid certificates this option forces an insecure mode of operation that turns the certificate verification errors into warnings and allows you to proceed if you encounter certificate verification errors or ones saying that common name doesn t match requested host name you can use this option to bypass the verification and proceed with the download only use this option if you are otherwise convinced of the site s authenticity or if you really don t care about the validity of its certificate it is almost always a bad idea not to check the certificates when transmitting confidential or important data for self-signed internal certificates you should download the certificate and verify against that instead of forcing this insecure mode if you are really sure of not desiring any certificate verification you can specify --check-certificate quiet to tell wget to not print any warning about invalid certificates albeit in most cases this is the wrong thing to do --certificate file use the client certificate stored in file this is needed for servers that are configured to require certificates from the clients that connect to them normally a certificate is not required and this switch is optional --certificate-type type specify the type of the client certificate legal values are pem assumed by default and der also known as asn1 --private-key file read the private key from file this allows you to provide the private key in a file separate from the certificate --private-key-type type specify the type of the private key accepted values are pem the default and der --ca-certificate file use file as the file with the bundle of certificate authorities ca to verify the peers the certificates must be in pem format without this option wget looks for ca certificates at the system- specified locations chosen at openssl installation time --ca-directory directory specifies directory containing ca certificates in pem format each file contains one ca certificate and the file name is based on a hash value derived from the certificate this is achieved by processing a certificate directory with the c rehash utility supplied with openssl using --ca-directory is more efficient than --ca-certificate when many certificates are installed because it allows wget to fetch certificates on demand without this option wget looks for ca certificates at the system- specified locations chosen at openssl installation time --crl-file file specifies a crl file in file this is needed for certificates that have been revocated by the cas --pinnedpubkey file hashes tells wget to use the specified public key file or hashes to verify the peer this can be a path to a file which contains a single public key in pem or der format or any number of base64 encoded sha256 hashes preceded by sha256 and separated by when negotiating a tls or ssl connection the server sends a certificate indicating its identity a public key is extracted from this certificate and if it does not exactly match the public key s provided to this option wget will abort the connection before sending or receiving any data --random-file file openssl and libressl only use file as the source of random data for seeding the pseudo-random number generator on systems without dev urandom on such systems the ssl library needs an external source of randomness to initialize randomness may be provided by egd see --egd-file below or read from an external source specified by the user if this option is not specified wget looks for random data in randfile or if that is unset in home rnd if you re getting the could not seed openssl prng disabling ssl error you should provide random data using some of the methods described above --egd-file file openssl only use file as the egd socket egd stands for entropy gathering daemon a user-space program that collects data from various unpredictable system sources and makes it available to other programs that might need it encryption software such as the ssl library needs sources of non-repeating randomness to seed the random number generator used to produce cryptographically strong keys openssl allows the user to specify his own source of entropy using the rand file environment variable if this variable is unset or if the specified file does not produce enough randomness openssl will read random data from egd socket specified using this option if this option is not specified and the equivalent startup command is not used egd is never contacted egd is not needed on modern unix systems that support dev urandom --no-hsts wget supports hsts http strict transport security rfc 6797 by default use --no-hsts to make wget act as a non-hsts-compliant ua as a consequence wget would ignore all the strict-transport-security headers and would not enforce any existing hsts policy --hsts-file file by default wget stores its hsts database in wget-hsts you can use --hsts-file to override this wget will use the supplied file as the hsts database such file must conform to the correct hsts database format used by wget if wget cannot parse the provided file the behaviour is unspecified the wget s hsts database is a plain text file each line contains an hsts entry ie a site that has issued a strict-transport-security header and that therefore has specified a concrete hsts policy to be applied lines starting with a dash are ignored by wget please note that in spite of this convenient human-readability hand-hacking the hsts database is generally not a good idea an hsts entry line consists of several fields separated by one or more whitespace hostname sp port sp include subdomains sp created sp max-age the hostname and port fields indicate the hostname and port to which the given hsts policy applies the port field may be zero and it will in most of the cases that means that the port number will not be taken into account when deciding whether such hsts policy should be applied on a given request only the hostname will be evaluated when port is different to zero both the target hostname and the port will be evaluated and the hsts policy will only be applied if both of them match this feature has been included for testing development purposes only the wget testsuite in testenv creates hsts databases with explicit ports with the purpose of ensuring wget s correct behaviour applying hsts policies to ports other than the default ones is discouraged by rfc 6797 see appendix b differences between hsts policy and same- origin policy thus this functionality should not be used in production environments and port will typically be zero the last three fields do what they are expected to the field include subdomains can either be 1 or 0 and it signals whether the subdomains of the target domain should be part of the given hsts policy as well the created and max-age fields hold the timestamp values of when such entry was created first seen by wget and the hsts-defined value max-age which states how long should that hsts policy remain active measured in seconds elapsed since the timestamp stored in created once that time has passed that hsts policy will no longer be valid and will eventually be removed from the database if you supply your own hsts database via --hsts-file be aware that wget may modify the provided file if any change occurs between the hsts policies requested by the remote servers and those in the file when wget exits it effectively updates the hsts database by rewriting the database file with the new entries if the supplied file does not exist wget will create one this file will contain the new hsts entries if no hsts entries were generated no strict-transport-security headers were sent by any of the servers then no file will be created not even an empty one this behaviour applies to the default database file wget-hsts as well it will not be created until some server enforces an hsts policy care is taken not to override possible changes made by other wget processes at the same time over the hsts database before dumping the updated hsts entries on the file wget will re-read it and merge the changes using a custom hsts database and or modifying an existing one is discouraged for more information about the potential security threats arose from such practice see section 14 security considerations of rfc 6797 specially section 14 9 creative manipulation of hsts policy store --warc-file file use file as the destination warc file --warc-header string use string into as the warcinfo record --warc-max-size size set the maximum size of the warc files to size --warc-cdx write cdx index files --warc-dedup file do not store records listed in this cdx file --no-warc-compression do not compress warc files with gzip --no-warc-digests do not calculate sha1 digests --no-warc-keep-log do not store the log file in a warc record --warc-tempdir dir specify the location for temporary files created by the warc writer ftp options --ftp-user user --ftp-password password specify the username user and password password on an ftp server without this or the corresponding startup option the password defaults to -wget normally used for anonymous ftp another way to specify username and password is in the url itself either method reveals your password to anyone who bothers to run ps to prevent the passwords from being seen store them in wgetrc or netrc and make sure to protect those files from other users with chmod if the passwords are really important do not leave them lying in those files either---edit the files and delete them after wget has started the download --no-remove-listing don t remove the temporary listing files generated by ftp retrievals normally these files contain the raw directory listings received from ftp servers not removing them can be useful for debugging purposes or when you want to be able to easily check on the contents of remote server directories e g to verify that a mirror you re running is complete note that even though wget writes to a known filename for this file this is not a security hole in the scenario of a user making listing a symbolic link to etc passwd or something and asking root to run wget in his or her directory depending on the options used either wget will refuse to write to listing making the globbing recursion time-stamping operation fail or the symbolic link will be deleted and replaced with the actual listing file or the listing will be written to a listing number file even though this situation isn t a problem though root should never run wget in a non-trusted user s directory a user could do something as simple as linking index html to etc passwd and asking root to run wget with -n or -r so the file will be overwritten --no-glob turn off ftp globbing globbing refers to the use of shell-like special characters wildcards like and to retrieve more than one file from the same directory at once like wget ftp gnjilux srk fer hr msg by default globbing will be turned on if the url contains a globbing character this option may be used to turn globbing on or off permanently you may have to quote the url to protect it from being expanded by your shell globbing makes wget look for a directory listing which is system-specific this is why it currently works only with unix ftp servers and the ones emulating unix ls output --no-passive-ftp disable the use of the passive ftp transfer mode passive ftp mandates that the client connect to the server to establish the data connection rather than the other way around if the machine is connected to the internet directly both passive and active ftp should work equally well behind most firewall and nat configurations passive ftp has a better chance of working however in some rare firewall configurations active ftp actually works when passive ftp doesn t if you suspect this to be the case use this option or set passive ftp off in your init file --preserve-permissions preserve remote file permissions instead of permissions set by umask --retr-symlinks by default when retrieving ftp directories recursively and a symbolic link is encountered the symbolic link is traversed and the pointed-to files are retrieved currently wget does not traverse symbolic links to directories to download them recursively though this feature may be added in the future when --retr-symlinks no is specified the linked-to file is not downloaded instead a matching symbolic link is created on the local file system the pointed-to file will not be retrieved unless this recursive retrieval would have encountered it separately and downloaded it anyway this option poses a security risk where a malicious ftp server may cause wget to write to files outside of the intended directories through a specially crafted listing file note that when retrieving a file not a directory because it was specified on the command-line rather than because it was recursed to this option has no effect symbolic links are always traversed in this case ftps options --ftps-implicit this option tells wget to use ftps implicitly implicit ftps consists of initializing ssl tls from the very beginning of the control connection this option does not send an auth tls command it assumes the server speaks ftps and directly starts an ssl tls connection if the attempt is successful the session continues just like regular ftps pbsz and prot are sent etc implicit ftps is no longer a requirement for ftps implementations and thus many servers may not support it if --ftps-implicit is passed and no explicit port number specified the default port for implicit ftps 990 will be used instead of the default port for the normal explicit ftps which is the same as that of ftp 21 --no-ftps-resume-ssl do not resume the ssl tls session in the data channel when starting a data connection wget tries to resume the ssl tls session previously started in the control connection ssl tls session resumption avoids performing an entirely new handshake by reusing the ssl tls parameters of a previous session typically the ftps servers want it that way so wget does this by default under rare circumstances however one might want to start an entirely new ssl tls session in every data connection this is what --no-ftps-resume-ssl is for --ftps-clear-data-connection all the data connections will be in plain text only the control connection will be under ssl tls wget will send a prot c command to achieve this which must be approved by the server --ftps-fallback-to-ftp fall back to ftp if ftps is not supported by the target server for security reasons this option is not asserted by default the default behaviour is to exit with an error if a server does not successfully reply to the initial auth tls command or in the case of implicit ftps if the initial ssl tls connection attempt is rejected it is considered that such server does not support ftps recursive retrieval options --recursive turn on recursive retrieving the default maximum depth is 5 --level depth set the maximum number of subdirectories that wget will recurse into to depth in order to prevent one from accidentally downloading very large websites when using recursion this is limited to a depth of 5 by default i e it will traverse at most 5 directories deep starting from the provided url set -l 0 or -l inf for infinite recursion depth wget -r -l 0 http site 1 html ideally one would expect this to download just 1 html but unfortunately this is not the case because -l 0 is equivalent to --delete-after this option tells wget to delete every single file it downloads after having done so it is useful for pre-fetching popular pages through a proxy e g wget -r -nd --delete-after http whatever com popular page the -r option is to retrieve recursively and -nd to not create directories note that --delete-after deletes files on the local machine it does not issue the dele command to remote ftp sites for instance also note that when --delete-after is specified --convert-links is ignored so orig files are simply not created in the first place --convert-links after the download is complete convert the links in the document to make them suitable for local viewing this affects not only the visible hyperlinks but any part of the document that links to external content such as embedded images links to style sheets hyperlinks to non-html content etc each link will be changed in one of the two ways the links to files that have been downloaded by wget will be changed to refer to the file they point to as a relative link example if the downloaded file foo doc html links to bar img gif also downloaded then the link in doc html will be modified to point to bar img gif this kind of transformation works reliably for arbitrary combinations of directories the links to files that have not been downloaded by wget will be changed to include host name and absolute path of the location they point to example if the downloaded file foo doc html links to bar img gif or to bar img gif then the link in doc html will be modified to point to http hostname bar img gif because of this local browsing works reliably if a linked file was downloaded the link will refer to its local name if it was not downloaded the link will refer to its full internet address rather than presenting a broken link the fact that the former links are converted to relative links ensures that you can move the downloaded hierarchy to another directory note that only at the end of the download can wget know which links have been downloaded because of that the work done by -k will be performed at the end of all the downloads --convert-file-only this option converts only the filename part of the urls leaving the rest of the urls untouched this filename part is sometimes referred to as the basename although we avoid that term here in order not to cause confusion it works particularly well in conjunction with --adjust-extension although this coupling is not enforced it proves useful to populate internet caches with files downloaded from different hosts example if some link points to foo com bar cgi xyz with --adjust-extension asserted and its local destination is intended to be foo com bar cgi xyz css then the link would be converted to foo com bar cgi xyz css note that only the filename part has been modified the rest of the url has been left untouched including the net path which would otherwise be processed by wget and converted to the effective scheme ie http --backup-converted when converting a file back up the original version with a orig suffix affects the behavior of -n --mirror turn on options suitable for mirroring this option turns on recursion and time-stamping sets infinite recursion depth and keeps ftp directory listings it is currently equivalent to -r -n -l inf --no-remove-listing --page-requisites this option causes wget to download all the files that are necessary to properly display a given html page this includes such things as inlined images sounds and referenced stylesheets ordinarily when downloading a single html page any requisite documents that may be needed to display it properly are not downloaded using -r together with -l can help but since wget does not ordinarily distinguish between external and inlined documents one is generally left with leaf documents that are missing their requisites for instance say document 1 html contains an img tag referencing 1 gif and an a tag pointing to external document 2 html say that 2 html is similar but that its image is 2 gif and it links to 3 html say this continues up to some arbitrarily high number if one executes the command wget -r -l 2 http site 1 html then 1 html 1 gif 2 html 2 gif and 3 html will be downloaded as you can see 3 html is without its requisite 3 gif because wget is simply counting the number of hops up to 2 away from 1 html in order to determine where to stop the recursion however with this command wget -r -l 2 -p http site 1 html all the above files and 3 html s requisite 3 gif will be downloaded similarly wget -r -l 1 -p http site 1 html will cause 1 html 1 gif 2 html and 2 gif to be downloaded one might think that wget -r -l 0 -p http site 1 html would download just 1 html and 1 gif but unfortunately this is not the case because -l 0 is equivalent to -l inf---that is infinite recursion to download a single html page or a handful of them all specified on the command-line or in a -i url input file and its or their requisites simply leave off -r and -l wget -p http site 1 html note that wget will behave as if -r had been specified but only that single page and its requisites will be downloaded links from that page to external documents will not be followed actually to download a single page and all its requisites even if they exist on separate websites and make sure the lot displays properly locally this author likes to use a few options in addition to -p wget -e -h -k -k -p http site document to finish off this topic it s worth knowing that wget s idea of an external document link is any url specified in an a tag an area tag or a link tag other than link rel stylesheet --strict-comments turn on strict parsing of html comments the default is to terminate comments at the first occurrence of -- according to specifications html comments are expressed as sgml declarations declaration is special markup that begins with and ends with such as doctype that may contain comments between a pair of -- delimiters html comments are empty declarations sgml declarations without any non-comment text therefore --foo-- is a valid comment and so is --one-- --two-- but --1--2-- is not on the other hand most html writers don t perceive comments as anything other than text delimited with -- and -- which is not quite the same for example something like ------------ works as a valid comment as long as the number of dashes is a multiple of four if not the comment technically lasts until the next -- which may be at the other end of the document because of this many popular browsers completely ignore the specification and implement what users have come to expect comments delimited with -- and -- until version 1 9 wget interpreted comments strictly which resulted in missing links in many web pages that displayed fine in browsers but had the misfortune of containing non-compliant comments beginning with version 1 9 wget has joined the ranks of clients that implements naive comments terminating each comment at the first occurrence of -- if for whatever reason you want strict comment parsing use this option to turn it on recursive accept reject options -a acclist --accept acclist --accept-regex urlregex --reject-regex urlregex specify a regular expression to accept or reject the complete url --regex-type regextype specify the regular expression type possible types are posix or pcre note that to be able to use pcre type wget has to be compiled with libpcre support --domains domain-list set domains to be followed domain-list is a comma-separated list of domains note that it does not turn on -h --exclude-domains domain-list specify the domains that are not to be followed --follow-ftp follow ftp links from html documents without this option wget will ignore all the ftp links --follow-tags list wget has an internal table of html tag attribute pairs that it considers when looking for linked documents during a recursive retrieval if a user wants only a subset of those tags to be considered however he or she should be specify such tags in a comma-separated list with this option --ignore-tags list this is the opposite of the --follow-tags option to skip certain html tags when recursively looking for documents to download specify them in a comma-separated list in the past this option was the best bet for downloading a single page and its requisites using a command-line like wget --ignore-tags a area -h -k -k -r http site document however the author of this option came across a page with tags like link rel home href and came to the realization that specifying tags to ignore was not enough one can t just tell wget to ignore link because then stylesheets will not be downloaded now the best bet for downloading a single page and its requisites is the dedicated --page-requisites option --ignore-case ignore case when matching files and directories this influences the behavior of -r -a -i and -x options as well as globbing implemented when downloading from ftp sites for example with this option -a txt will match file1 txt but also file2 txt file3 txt and so on the quotes in the example are to prevent the shell from expanding the pattern --span-hosts enable spanning across hosts when doing recursive retrieving --relative follow relative links only useful for retrieving a specific home page without any distractions not even those from the same hosts --include-directories list specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to follow when downloading elements of list may contain wildcards --exclude-directories list specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to exclude from download elements of list may contain wildcards --no-parent do not ever ascend to the parent directory when retrieving recursively this is a useful option since it guarantees that only

In certain cases, the local file will be clobbered, or overwritten, upon repeated download.  In other cases it will be preserved. When running Wget without -N, -nc, -r, or -p, downloading the same file in the same directory will result in the original copy of file being preserved and the second copy being named file.1.  If that file is downloaded yet again, the third copy will be named file.2, and so on.  (This is also the behavior with -nd, even if -r or -p are in effect.)  When -nc is specified, this behavior is suppressed, and Wget will refuse to download newer copies of file. Therefore, \"\"no-clobber\"\" is actually a misnomer in this mode---it's not clobbering that's prevented (as the numeric suffixes were already preventing clobbering), but rather the multiple version saving that's prevented. When running Wget with -r or -p, but without -N, -nd, or -nc, re- downloading a file will result in the new copy simply overwriting the old.  Adding -nc will prevent this behavior, instead causing the original version to be preserved and any newer copies on the server to be ignored. When running Wget with -N, with or without -r or -p, the decision as to whether or not to download a newer copy of a file depends on the local and remote timestamp and size of the file.  -nc may not be specified at the same time as -N. A combination with -O/--output-document is only accepted if the given output file does not exist.

For instance: wget -c ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z If there is a file named ls-lR.Z in the current directory, Wget will assume that it is the first portion of the remote file, and will ask the server to continue the retrieval from an offset equal to the length of the local file. Note that you don't need to specify this option if you just want the current invocation of Wget to retry downloading a file should the connection be lost midway through.  This is the default behavior.  -c only affects resumption of downloads started prior to this invocation of Wget, and whose local files are still sitting around. Without -c, the previous example would just download the remote file to ls-lR.Z.1, leaving the truncated ls-lR.Z file alone. If you use -c on a non-empty file, and the server does not support continued downloading, Wget will restart the download from scratch and overwrite the existing file entirely. Beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use -c on a file which is of equal size as the one on the server, Wget will refuse to download the file and print an explanatory message.  The same happens when the file is smaller on the server than locally (presumably because it was changed on the server since your last download attempt)---because \"continuing\" is not meaningful, no download occurs. On the other side of the coin, while using -c, any file that's bigger on the server than locally will be considered an incomplete download and only \"(length(remote) - length(local))\" bytes will be downloaded and tacked onto the end of the local file.  This behavior can be desirable in certain cases---for instance, you can use wget -c to download just the new portion that's been appended to a data collection or log file. However, if the file is bigger on the server because it's been changed, as opposed to just appended to, you'll end up with a garbled file.  Wget has no way of verifying that the local file is really a valid prefix of the remote file.  You need to be especially careful of this when using -c in conjunction with -r, since every file will be considered as an \"incomplete download\" candidate.

It draws an ASCII progress bar graphics (a.k.a \"thermometer\" display) indicating the status of retrieval.  If the output is not a TTY, the \"dot\" bar will be used by default. Use --progress=dot to switch to the \"dot\" display.  It traces the retrieval by printing dots on the screen, each dot representing a fixed amount of downloaded data. The progress type can also take one or more parameters.  The parameters vary based on the type selected.\tParameters to type are passed by appending them to the type sperated by a colon (:) like this: --progress=type:parameter1:parameter2. When using the dotted retrieval, you may set the style by specifying the type as dot:style.  Different styles assign different meaning to one dot.  With the \"default\" style each dot represents 1K, there are ten dots in a cluster and 50 dots in a line.  The \"binary\" style has a more \"computer\"-like orientation---8K dots, 16-dots clusters and 48 dots per line (which makes for 384K lines).  The \"mega\" style is suitable for downloading large files---each dot represents 64K retrieved, there are eight dots in a cluster, and 48 dots on each line (so each line contains 3M).  If \"mega\" is not enough then you can use the \"giga\" style---each dot represents 1M retrieved, there are eight dots in a cluster, and 32 dots on each line (so each line contains 32M). With --progress=bar, there are currently two possible parameters, force and noscroll. When the output is not a TTY, the progress bar always falls back to \"dot\", even if --progress=bar was passed to Wget during invocation. This behaviour can be overridden and the \"bar\" output forced by using the \"force\" parameter as --progress=bar:force. By default, the bar style progress bar scroll the name of the file from left to right for the file being downloaded if the filename exceeds the maximum length allotted for its display.  In certain cases, such as with --progress=bar:force, one may not want the scrolling filename in the progress bar.  By passing the \"noscroll\" parameter, Wget can be forced to display as much of the filename as possible without scrolling through it. Note that you can set the default style using the \"progress\" command in .wgetrc.\tThat setting may be overridden from the command line.  For example, to force the bar output without scrolling, use --progress=bar:force:noscroll."

Characters that are restricted by this option are escaped, i.e. replaced with %HH, where HH is the hexadecimal number that corresponds to the restricted character. This option may also be used to force all alphabetical cases to be either lower- or uppercase. By default, Wget escapes the characters that are not valid or safe as part of file names on your operating system, as well as control characters that are typically unprintable.  This option is useful for changing these defaults, perhaps because you are downloading to a non-native partition, or because you want to disable escaping of the control characters, or you want to further restrict characters to only those in the ASCII range of values. The modes are a comma-separated set of text values. The acceptable values are unix, windows, nocontrol, ascii, lowercase, and uppercase. The values unix and windows are mutually exclusive (one will override the other), as are lowercase and uppercase. Those last are special cases, as they do not change the set of characters that would be escaped, but rather force local file paths to be converted either to lower- or uppercase. When \"unix\" is specified, Wget escapes the character / and the control characters in the ranges 0--31 and 128--159.  This is the default on Unix-like operating systems. When \"windows\" is given, Wget escapes the characters \\, |, /, :, ?, \", *, <, >, and the control characters in the ranges 0--31 and 128--159.  In addition to this, Wget in Windows mode uses + instead of : to separate host and port in local file names, and uses @ instead of ? to separate the query portion of the file name from the rest.  Therefore, a URL that would be saved as www.xemacs.org:4300/search.pl?input=blah in Unix mode would be saved as www.xemacs.org+4300/search.pl@input=blah in Windows mode. This mode is the default on Windows. If you specify nocontrol, then the escaping of the control characters is also switched off. This option may make sense when you are downloading URLs whose names contain UTF-8 characters, on a system which can save and display filenames in UTF-8 (some possible byte values used in UTF-8 byte sequences fall in the range of values designated by Wget as \"controls\"). The ascii mode is used to specify that any bytes whose values are outside the range of ASCII characters (that is, greater than 127) shall be escaped. This can be useful when saving filenames whose encoding does not match the one used locally."

Such file must conform to the correct HSTS database format used by Wget. If Wget cannot parse the provided file, the behaviour is unspecified. The Wget's HSTS database is a plain text file. Each line contains an HSTS entry (ie. a site that has issued a \"Strict-Transport-Security\" header and that therefore has specified a concrete HSTS policy to be applied). Lines starting with a dash (\"#\") are ignored by Wget. Please note that in spite of this convenient human-readability hand-hacking the HSTS database is generally not a good idea. An HSTS entry line consists of several fields separated by one or more whitespace: \"<hostname> SP [<port>] SP <include subdomains> SP <created> SP <max-age>\" The hostname and port fields indicate the hostname and port to which the given HSTS policy applies. The port field may be zero, and it will, in most of the cases. That means that the port number will not be taken into account when deciding whether such HSTS policy should be applied on a given request (only the hostname will be evaluated). When port is different to zero, both the target hostname and the port will be evaluated and the HSTS policy will only be applied if both of them match. This feature has been included for testing/development purposes only.  The Wget testsuite (in testenv/) creates HSTS databases with explicit ports with the purpose of ensuring Wget's correct behaviour. Applying HSTS policies to ports other than the default ones is discouraged by RFC 6797 (see Appendix B \"Differences between HSTS Policy and Same- Origin Policy\"). Thus, this functionality should not be used in production environments and port will typically be zero. The last three fields do what they are expected to. The field include_subdomains can either be 1 or 0 and it signals whether the subdomains of the target domain should be part of the given HSTS policy as well. The created and max-age fields hold the timestamp values of when such entry was created (first seen by Wget) and the HSTS-defined value 'max-age', which states how long should that HSTS policy remain active, measured in seconds elapsed since the timestamp stored in created. Once that time has passed, that HSTS policy will no longer be valid and will eventually be removed from the database. If you supply your own HSTS database via --hsts-file, be aware that Wget may modify the provided file if any change occurs between the HSTS policies requested by the remote servers and those in the file. When Wget exits, it effectively updates the HSTS database by rewriting the database file with the new entries. If the supplied file does not exist, Wget will create one. This file will contain the new HSTS entries. If no HSTS entries were generated (no \"Strict-Transport-Security\" headers were sent by any of the servers) then no file will be created, not even an empty one. This behaviour applies to the default database file (~/.wget-hsts) as well: it will not be created until some server enforces an HSTS policy. Care is taken not to override possible changes made by other Wget processes at the same time over the HSTS database. Before dumping the updated HSTS entries on the file, Wget will re-read it and merge the changes. Using a custom HSTS database and/or modifying an existing one is discouraged.  For more information about the potential security threats arose from such practice, see section 14 \"Security Considerations\" of RFC 6797, specially section 14.9 \"Creative Manipulation of HSTS Policy Store\"."

Example: if the downloaded file /foo/doc.html links to /bar/img.gif, also downloaded, then the link in doc.html will be modified to point to ../bar/img.gif.\tThis kind of transformation works reliably for arbitrary combinations of directories. •   The links to files that have not been downloaded by Wget will be changed to include host name and absolute path of the location they point to. Example: if the downloaded file /foo/doc.html links to /bar/img.gif (or to ../bar/img.gif), then the link in doc.html will be modified to point to http://hostname/bar/img.gif. Because of this, local browsing works reliably: if a linked file was downloaded, the link will refer to its local name; if it was not downloaded, the link will refer to its full Internet address rather than presenting a broken link.  The fact that the former links are converted to relative links ensures that you can move the downloaded hierarchy to another directory.

This includes such things as inlined images, sounds, and referenced stylesheets. Ordinarily, when downloading a single HTML page, any requisite documents that may be needed to display it properly are not downloaded.\tUsing -r together with -l can help, but since Wget does not ordinarily distinguish between external and inlined documents, one is generally left with \"leaf documents\" that are missing their requisites. For instance, say document 1.html contains an \"<IMG>\" tag referencing 1.gif and an \"<A>\" tag pointing to external document 2.html.  Say that 2.html is similar but that its image is 2.gif and it links to 3.html.\tSay this continues up to some arbitrarily high number. If one executes the command: wget -r -l 2 http://<site>/1.html then 1.html, 1.gif, 2.html, 2.gif, and 3.html will be downloaded. As you can see, 3.html is without its requisite 3.gif because Wget is simply counting the number of hops (up to 2) away from 1.html in order to determine where to stop the recursion.  However, with this command: wget -r -l 2 -p http://<site>/1.html all the above files and 3.html's requisite 3.gif will be downloaded.\tSimilarly, wget -r -l 1 -p http://<site>/1.html will cause 1.html, 1.gif, 2.html, and 2.gif to be downloaded.  One might think that: wget -r -l 0 -p http://<site>/1.html would download just 1.html and 1.gif, but unfortunately this is not the case, because -l 0 is equivalent to -l inf---that is, infinite recursion.  To download a single HTML page (or a handful of them, all specified on the command-line or in a -i URL input file) and its (or their) requisites, simply leave off -r and -l: wget -p http://<site>/1.html Note that Wget will behave as if -r had been specified, but only that single page and its requisites will be downloaded.  Links from that page to external documents will not be followed.  Actually, to download a single page and all its requisites (even if they exist on separate websites), and make sure the lot displays properly locally, this author likes to use a few options in addition to -p: wget -E -H -k -K -p http://<site>/<document> To finish off this topic, it's worth knowing that Wget's idea of an external document link is any URL specified in an \"<A>\" tag, an \"<AREA>\" tag, or a \"<LINK>\" tag other than \"<LINK REL=\"stylesheet\">\"."
