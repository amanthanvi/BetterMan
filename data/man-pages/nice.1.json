The lower the nice value of a process, the higher its\n     scheduling priority.\n\n     The superuser may specify a negative increment in order to run a utility\n     with a higher scheduling priority.\n\n     Some shells may provide a builtin nice command which is similar or\n     identical to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.\n",

        "     If utility is invoked, the exit status of nice is the exit status of\n     utility.\n\n     An exit status of 126 indicates utility was found, but could not be\n     executed.\tAn exit status of 127 indicates utility could not be found.\n",
