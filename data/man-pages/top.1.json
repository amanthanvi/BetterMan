        "     The top program periodically displays a sorted list of system processes.\n     The default sorting key is pid, but other keys can be used instead.\n     Various output options are available.\n",
        "     Command line option specifications are processed from left to right.\n     Options can be specified more than once.  If conflicting options are\n     specified, later specifications override earlier ones.  This makes it\n     viable to create a shell alias for top with preferred defaults specified,\n     then override those preferred defaults as desired on the command line.\n\n     -a      Equivalent to -c a.\n\n     -c mode\n\t     Set event counting mode to mode.  The supported modes are\n\n\t     a\t     Accumulative mode.  Count events cumulatively, starting\n\t\t     at the launch of top.  Calculate CPU usage and CPU time\n\t\t     since the launch of top.\n\n\t     d\t     Delta mode.  Count events relative to the previous\n\t\t     sample.  Calculate CPU usage since the previous sample.\n\t\t     This mode by default disables the memory object map\n\t\t     reporting.  The memory object map reporting may be re-\n\t\t     enabled with the -r option or the interactive r command.\n\n\t     e\t     Absolute mode.  Count events using absolute counters.\n\n\t     n\t     Non-event mode (default).\tCalculate CPU usage since the\n\t\t     previous sample.\n\n     -d      Equivalent to -c d.\n\n     -e      Equivalent to -c e.\n\n     -F      Do not calculate statistics on shared libraries, also known as\n\t     frameworks.\n\n     -f      Calculate statistics on shared libraries, also known as\n\t     frameworks (default).\n\n     -h      Print command line usage information and exit.\n\n     -i interval\n\t     Update framework (-f) info every interval samples; see the\n\t     PERFORMANCE/ACCURACY TRADEOFF section for more details.\n\n     -l samples\n\t     Use logging mode and display samples samples, even if standard\n\t     output is a terminal.  0 is treated as infinity.  Rather than\n\t     redisplaying, output is periodically printed in raw form.\tNote\n\t     that the first sample displayed will have an invalid %CPU\n\t     displayed for each process, as it is calculated using the delta\n\t     between samples.\n\n     -ncols columns\n\t     Display columns when using logging mode.  The default is\n\t     infinite.\tThe number must be > 0 or an error will occur.\n\n     -n nprocs\n\t     Only display up to nprocs processes.\n\n     -O skey\n\t     Use skey as a secondary key when ordering the process display.\n\t     See -o for key names (pid is the default).\n\n     -o key  Order the process display by sorting on key in descending order.\n\t     A + or - can be prefixed to the key name to specify ascending or\n\t     descending order, respectively.

        "     When top is run in interactive (non-logging) mode, it is possible to\n     control the output of top, as well as interactively send signals to\n     processes.  The interactive command syntax is terse.  Each command is one\n     character, followed by 0 to 2 arguments.  Commands that take arguments\n     prompt interactively for the arguments, and where applicable, the default\n     value is shown in square brackets.  The default value can be selected by\n     leaving the input field blank and pressing enter.\t^G escapes the\n     interactive argument prompt, and has the same effect as leaving the input\n     field blank and pressing enter.\n\n     The following commands are supported:\n\n     ?\t     Display the help screen.
