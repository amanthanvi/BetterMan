This may also be\n\t   achieved by appending ‘\\c’ to the end of the string, as is done by\n\t   iBCS2 compatible systems.  Note that this option as well as the\n\t   effect of ‘\\c’ are implementation-defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001\n\t   (“POSIX.1”) as amended by Cor. 1-2002.  Applications aiming for\n\t   maximum portability are strongly encouraged to use printf(1) to\n\t   suppress the newline character.\n\n     Some shells may provide a builtin echo command which is similar or\n     identical to this utility.  Most notably, the builtin echo in sh(1) does\n     not accept the -n option.\tConsult the builtin(1) manual page.\n",
